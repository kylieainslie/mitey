# The `mitey` package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The motivation behind creating the `mitey` package was twofold: 1) to provide the data and code to reproduce the results in Ainslie, K, M. Hooiveld, and J. Wallinga. 2024. On the epidemiological characteristics of scabies. *(in preparations)*, and 2) to provide flexible, documented code for methods not previously available in `R` that can help estimate epidemiological quantities of interest.

## Installation

1.  Install [R](http://cran.r-project.org)

2.  Install the development version of serosolver from
    [GitHub](https://github.com/kylieainslie/mitey):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kylieainslie/mitey")
```

## Guide and vignettes

A quick start guide and detailed vignettes are still in development.

Validation of the method used to estimate the mean and standard
deviation of the serial interval proposed by [Vink et
al.Â 2014](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwu209) can be found [here](https://kylieainslie.github.io/mitey/articles/code_validation_for_Vink_method.html)

## Example

This is a basic example of estimating the mean serial interval from data
on time of symptom onset for an infectious disease. We first simulate
index case-to-case (ICC) intervals. Here, we directly simulate the ICC
intervals based on their route of transmission. The specified mean
serial interval `hmu` is 15 and the specified standard deviation
`hsigma` is 3. The weights for each route of transmission are specified
as `hw1`, `hw2`, `hw3`, and `hw4`, respectively.

``` r
library(mitey)
library(fdrtool)
```

``` r
set.seed(1234)

N <- 2500; hmu<-15; hsigma<-3; hw1 <- 0.2; hw2 <- 0.5; hw3 <- 0.2; hw4 <- 0.1

CP <- rhalfnorm((hw1*N),theta=sqrt(pi/2)/(sqrt(2)*hsigma))
PS <- rnorm(hw2*N,mean=hmu,sd=hsigma)
PT <- rnorm(hw3*N,mean=2*hmu,sd=sqrt(2)*hsigma)
PQ <- rnorm(hw4*N,mean=3*hmu,sd=sqrt(3)*hsigma)

sim_data <- round(c(CP,PS,PT,PQ))
```

We can look at our simulated data by plotting them as a histogram.

Then, we estimate the mean and standard deviation of the simulated
serial interval using the `si_estim` function.

``` r
results<- si_estim(sim_data, dist = "normal")
results
#> $mean
#> [1] 15.03357
#> 
#> $sd
#> [1] 2.786672
#> 
#> $wts
#> [1] 2.100299e-01 4.823883e-01 6.706310e-09 2.003141e-01 2.304775e-15
#> [6] 1.072676e-01 9.057491e-22
```

The output of `si_estim` is a named list with elements `mean`, `sd`, and
`wts`, which contain the estimated mean, standard deviation, and weights
of the serial interval distribution, respectively. We see that using the
simulated data and assuming an underlying normal distribution, we obtain
estimates very close to the input values: a mean serial interval
estimate of 15.03 and a standard deviation of 2.79. We are also able to
recapture the input weights: hw1 = 0.21, hw2 = 0.48, hw3 = 0.2, hw4 =
0.11.

Using the `plot_si_fit` function, we can use the outputs of `si_estim`
to plot the fitted serial interval over the symptom onset data.

``` r
plot_si_fit(
    dat = sim_data,
    mean = results$mean[1],
    sd = results$sd[1],
    weights = c(results$wts[1], results$wts[2] + results$wts[3],
                results$wts[4] + results$wts[5], results$wts[6] + results$wts[7]),
    dist = "normal"
  )
```
