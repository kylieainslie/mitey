# mitey: Serial Interval and Case Reproduction Number Estimation

Provides methods to estimate serial intervals and time-varying case
reproduction numbers from infectious disease outbreak data. Serial
intervals measure the time between symptom onset in linked transmission
pairs, while case reproduction numbers quantify how many secondary cases
each infected individual generates over time. These parameters are
essential for understanding transmission dynamics, evaluating control
measures, and informing public health responses. The package implements
the maximum likelihood framework from Vink et al. (2014)
[doi:10.1093/aje/kwu209](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwu209) for serial
interval estimation and the retrospective method from Wallinga &
Lipsitch (2007)
[doi:10.1098/rspb.2006.3754](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2006.3754) for
reproduction number estimation. Originally developed for scabies
transmission analysis but applicable to other infectious diseases
including influenza, COVID-19, and emerging pathogens. Designed for
epidemiologists, public health researchers, and infectious disease
modelers working with outbreak surveillance data.
