# Calculate f0 for Different Components

This function calculates the value of f0 based on the component, where
the components represent the transmission routes: Co-Primary (CP),
Primary-Secondary (PS), Primary-Tertiary (PT), and Primary-Quaternary
(PQ). We split the PS, PT and PQ routes into two parts, such that

- component 1: CP route

- component 2+3: PS route

- component 4+5: PT route

- component 6+7: PQ route

## Usage

``` r
f0(x, mu, sigma, comp, dist = "normal")
```

## Arguments

- x:

  numeric; the value at which to evaluate the function.

- mu:

  numeric; the mean value.

- sigma:

  numeric; the standard deviation.

- comp:

  integer; the component number (1 to 7).

- dist:

  string; assumed distribution of the serial interval; takes "normal" or
  "gamma"; defaults to "normal"

## Value

The calculated value of f0.

## Details

If the dist = gamma, then the mean (\\\mu\\) and standard deviation
(sigma) are converted into the shape (k) and scale (theta) parameters
for the gamma distribution, such that the mean (\\\mu\\ ) and variance
(\\\sigma^2\\) are given by: \$\$\mu = k \times \theta\$\$ \$\$\sigma^2
= k \times \theta^2\$\$.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Basic example with normal distribution
f0(x = 0.5, mu = 12, sigma = 3, comp = 2, dist = "normal")

# Same parameters with gamma distribution
f0(x = 0.5, mu = 12, sigma = 3, comp = 2, dist = "gamma")
} # }
```
