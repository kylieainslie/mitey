Since scabies transmission shown driven adolescents young adults6,7, seasonal epidemics can seeded start school year peak winter reaching trough late spring summer school year ends. Conversely, peak transmission occur summer people wearing less clothing; therefore, making skin--skin contact probable, cases detected much later fall winter. Interestingly, contrast almost notifiable infectious diseases, found numbers scabies cases increased COVID-19 pandemic (relative years prior pandemic). infectious diseases, non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses, saw decreased incidence COVID-19 pandemic due effective control measures35 underreporting underdiagnosis6. increase scabies infections COVID-19 pandemic also observed countries, Ireland36, Spain37, Ethiopia38, Turkey39. increases scabies infestations likely due increased indoor contact result COVID-19 lockdowns control measures restricted personal movement, curfews6, often led people staying overnight. time indoors, members households share space long periods, may increase risk transmitting scabies mites direct contact fomites36,37. Another explanation increase scabies incidence Netherlands increased media coverage scabies since 2021, may resulted scabies awareness diagnoses previous years. study several limitations. First, estimating serial interval reproduction number, assume infection person’s first infection. time symptom onset infection (incubation period) described 4-6 weeks person’s first infection, 24 hours subsequent infections15. significant portion individuals experiencing post-primary infection, estimated mean serial interval likely overestimated. Therefore, estimates considered upper bounds average serial interval. Second, estimating time-varying reproduction number, used pooled mean standard deviation serial interval meta-analysis across studies scabies epidemics. studies varied setting, geographic location, study population, individual estimates mean serial interval varied considerably across studies. possible using pooled mean standard deviation meta-analysis represent true mean serial interval among Dutch population; however, estimates exist. Third, estimate time-varying reproduction number used data date scabies consultations. data proxy true disease incidence data person may consultation GP multiple times infection. may cause overestimation number infections per week. also assume date symptom onset consistent date consultation (subsequent scabies diagnosis). Since know delay infection consultation/diagnosis, precisely pinpoint time transmission events occur. study scabies epidemic Germany, index case diagnosed approximately 3 months following symptom onset20. delay diagnosis can due fact scabies symptoms unique scabies (itching, rash) misdiagnosed first. correcting delay symptom onset diagnosis scabies cases improve estimates time-varying reproduction number based time infection, information routinely collected making correction delay difficult. study highlights import areas future research, namely, ) collecting data scabies transmissions pairs estimate serial interval; b) characterizing delay symptom onset GP consultation/diagnosis correct estimates time-varying reproduction number estimated using GP consultations data; c) reproducing estimates incubation period scabies. estimate incubation period scabies range provided Mellanby 4-6 weeks15. data original study literature support estimate provide point estimate confidence bounds.
