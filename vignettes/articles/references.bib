               units (PICUs), with the objectives of describing a cohort of
               infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection,
               comparing hospital diagnosis with PCR results and investigating
               the spread of RSV in families. Eligible infants were under 5
               months old and admitted betweem November 1998 and October 1999
               with respiratory failure, apnoea and/or bradycardia or acute life
               threatening episodes (ALTE). We diagnosed RSV by PCR analysis of
               nasopharyngeal aspirate, and in contacts by PCR of pernasal
               swabs. Of the 137 eligible infants, 66\% (91/137) were recruited;
               of these, 82\% (75/91) had RSV, with 47\% (35/75) diagnosed by
               hospital laboratory tests and 93\% (70/75) by PCR. The median
               duration of ventilation was 4.4 days, the length of stay on PICU,
               8.6 days, and the length of stay in hospital, 15.9 days. In most
               families (62\%), the parents and siblings developed symptoms of
               RSV infection at the same time as the infant. When the index
               infant was a secondary case, primary cases occurred in both older
               siblings (16 families) and adults (11 families). Silent RSV
               infection occurred frequently amongst children and adults. RSV is
               under-diagnosed in PICUs. PCR increases the rate of diagnosis of
               RSV compared to routine hospital diagnostic methods. Young
               infants are most often infected at the same time as or before
               their parents and siblings, indicating that the source may be
               outside the household; vaccinating family members may not prevent
               RSV infection in infants.",

               household of infants aged 6 months admitted to the hospital for
               pertussis in the Netherlands. METHODS: During the period
               2006-2008, a total of 560 household contacts of 164 hospitalized
               infants were tested by polymerase chain reaction, culture, and
               serological examination to establish Bordetella pertussis
               infection. Clinical symptoms and vaccination history were
               obtained by a questionnaire submitted during sample collection
               and 4-6 weeks afterwards. RESULTS: Overall, 299 household
               contacts (53\%) had laboratory-confired pertussis; 159 (53\%) had
               symptoms compatible with typical pertussis infection, and 42
               (14\%) had no symptoms. Among children vaccinated with a
               whole-cell vaccine, 17 (46\%) of 37 had typical pertussis 1-3
               years after completion of the primary series, compared with 9
               (29\%) of 31 children who had been completely vaccinated with an
               acellular vaccine. For 96 households (60\%), the most likely
               source of infection of the infant was established, being a
               sibling (41\%), mother (38\%), or father (17\%). CONCLUSIONS: If
               immunity to pertussis in parents is maintained or boosted,
               35\%-55\% of infant cases could be prevented. Furthermore, we
               found that, 1-3 years after vaccination with whole-cell or
               acellular vaccine, a significant percentage of children are again
               susceptible for typical pertussis. In the long term, pertussis
               vaccines and vaccination strategies should be improved to provide
               longer protection and prevent transmission.",

              duration between symptom onset of a primary case and symptom
              onset of its secondary cases. A good evidence base for such
              values is essential, because they allow investigators to identify
              epidemiologic links between cases and serve as an important
              parameter in epidemic transmission models used to design
              infection control strategies. We reviewed the literature for
              available data sets containing serial intervals and for reported
              values of serial intervals. We were able to collect data on
              outbreaks within households, which we reanalyzed to infer a mean
              serial interval using a common statistical method. We estimated
              the mean serial intervals for influenza A(H3N2) (2.2 days),
              pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2.8 days), respiratory syncytial

              value that deviates substantially from the 21 days commonly used
              in transmission models. This value of the serial interval for
              pertussis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first that is

               renewed interest, as the vaccination of children is currently
               under debate and antiviral treatments have been approved for
               prophylactic use. AIMS: To quantify the risk factors of influenza
               transmission in households. DESIGN OF STUDY: A prospective study
               conducted during the 1999 to 2000 winter season in France.
               SETTING: Nine hundred and forty-six households where a member,
               the index patient, had visited their general practitioner (GP)
               because of an influenza-like illness were enrolled in the study.
               Five hundred and ten of the index patients tested positive for
               influenza A (subtype H3N2). A standardised daily questionnaire
               allowed for identification of secondary cases of influenza among
               their household contacts, who were followed-up for 15 days. Of
               the 395 (77\%) households that completed the questionnaire, we
               selected 279 where no additional cases had occurred on the day of
               the index patient's visit to the GP. METHODS: Secondary cases of
               influenza were those household contacts who had developed
               clinical influenza within 5 days of the disease onset in the
               index patient. Hazard ratios for individual clinical and
               demographic characteristics of the contact and their index
               patient were derived from a Cox regression model. RESULTS:
               Overall in the 279 households, 131 (24.1\%) secondary cases
               occurred among the 543 household contacts. There was an increased
               risk of influenza transmission in preschool contacts (hazard
               ratio [HR] = 1.85, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 3.26)
               as compared with school-age and adult contacts. There was also an
               increased risk in contacts exposed to preschool index patients
               (HR = 1.93, 95\% CI = 1.09 to 3.42) and school-age index patients
               (HR = 1.68, 95\% CI = 1.07 to 2.65), compared with those exposed
               to adult index cases. No other factor was associated with
               transmission of the disease. CONCLUSION: Our results support the
               major role of children in the dissemination of influenza in
               households. Vaccination of children or prophylaxis with
               neuraminidase inhibitors would prevent, respectively, 32-38\% and
               21-41\% of secondary cases caused by exposure to a sick child in
               the household.",

               Taipei. We investigated an outbreak to determine varicella
               vaccine coverage and effectiveness. METHODS: An outbreak occurred
               in an elementary school which located in southern Taipei from
               April 2007 through May 2007. A retrospect cohort study was
               performed by using a self-administered questionnaire for parents.
               RESULTS: Ten out of sixteen varicella cases were vaccinated.
               Overall vaccine coverage was 71.2\%. The common reasons for not
               receiving varicella vaccine were that varicella vaccine was
               unavailable because the student didn't live in Taipei (29.4\%) or
               the children could not be vaccinated due to certain illnesses
               (23.5\%). The sensitivity and specificity of self-reported
               vaccination status was 0.900 (95\% CI: 0.864, 0.935) and 0.611
               (95\% CI: 0.514, 0.701).The vaccine effectiveness was
               69.3\%-100.0\% against any disease severity of varicella. Overall
               vaccine effectiveness against moderate or severe varicella was
               85.5\%. Attending cram school was associated with the risk of
               developing the varicella illness (RR: 13.39; 95\% CI: 5.38,
               33.31). Unvaccinated students tended to show moderate to severe
               (>50 lesions) afflictions of the disease (RR: 4.17; 95\% CI:
               1.15, 15.14). CONCLUSIONS: Because of the low vaccination
               coverage, varicella outbreaks continue to be reported in Taipei.
               Increasing vaccine coverage and second dose vaccination for
               increasing vaccine effectiveness may be considered.",

               (CP) occurred at a child care centre in Perth, Western Australia.
               An epidemiological study was undertaken in order to determine the
               characteristics of the outbreak, assess vaccine effectiveness,
               and to define the direct and indirect costs associated with CP
               infections in young children. METHODS: A cohort study of the
               outbreak utilising attendance records and a telephone survey of
               parents was conducted. RESULTS: Of the 211 children attending the
               child care centre at the time of the outbreak, 44 contracted CP
               (attack rate 25.7\%). In addition, two staff members, five
               secondary household contacts (secondary attack rate 38.5\%) and
               four secondary non-household associated contacts were infected.
               There were no severe complications or any hospitalisations
               recorded in infected persons. Two cases had been vaccinated
               previously. Vaccine effectiveness for CP of any severity was
               78.0\% (95\% CI 15.4-94.3\%) while vaccine effectiveness against
               severe CP was 100\%. Direct costs during this outbreak were
               estimated to be $54 per case and the total costs, including cost
               of parental time off work or study, were estimated to be $525.73
               per case. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Although morbidity
               associated with CP in young children is not great, infection in
               childhood is almost universal. This study found that the average
               costs associated with each CP case were considerable. Since
               varicella vaccine affords good protection against CP, the recent
               inclusion of this vaccine in the Australian childhood vaccination
               schedule should save the community a considerable amount in
               direct and indirect costs if high coverage rates can be achieved.",

               determined by the time from infection to infectiousness, the
               duration of infectiousness, the time from infection to disease
               onset (incubation period), the duration of any extra-human phase
               of the infectious agent, and the proportion clinically affected
               among infected individuals. The interval is important in the
               interpretation of infectious disease surveillance and trend data,
               in the identification of outbreaks, and in the optimization of
               quarantine and contact tracing. This paper discusses the
               properties of these intervals, as measured between transmission
               events or between clinical onsets of successive infected
               individuals, noting the determinants of their ranges and
               frequency distributions, the circumstances under which secondary

               transmission interval will be different from the interval between

               of interval distribution statistics from descriptive data given
               in standard textbooks, with illustrations from published data on
               outbreaks, households, and epidemiologic tracing. Finally, it
               discusses the implications of such measures for studies of
               secondary attack rates, for the persistence of infection in human
               communities, for outbreak response, and for elimination or

               influenza A (H1N1) virus in various exposure settings and
               determining whether transmissibility differed from seasonal
               influenza viruses was a priority for decision making on
               mitigation strategies at the beginning of the pandemic. The
               objective of this study was to estimate household secondary
               attack rates for pandemic influenza in a susceptible population
               where control measures had yet to be implemented. METHODS: All
               Ontario local health units were invited to participate; seven
               health units volunteered. For all laboratory-confirmed cases
               reported between April 24 and June 18, 2009, participating health
               units performed contact tracing to detect secondary cases among
               household contacts. In total, 87 cases and 266 household contacts
               were included in this study. Secondary cases were defined as any
               household member with new onset of acute respiratory illness
               (fever or two or more respiratory symptoms) or influenza-like
               illness (fever plus one additional respiratory symptom). Attack
               rates were estimated using both case definitions. RESULTS:
               Secondary attack rates were estimated at 10.3\% (95\% CI
               6.8-14.7) for secondary cases with influenza-like illness and
               20.2\% (95\% CI 15.4-25.6) for secondary cases with acute
               respiratory illness. For both case definitions, attack rates were
               significantly higher in children under 16 years than adults
               (25.4\% and 42.4\% compared to 7.6\% and 17.2\%). The median time
               between symptom onset in the primary case and the secondary case
               was estimated at 3.0 days. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary attack rates
               for pandemic influenza A (H1N1) were comparable to seasonal
               influenza estimates suggesting similarities in transmission. High
               secondary attack rates in children provide additional support for
               increased susceptibility to infection.",

               pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus (pH1N1) is critical for the

               Our objectives were to estimate the secondary attack rates
               (SARs), the proportion of asymptomatic infections, and risk
               factors for pH1N1 transmission within households on the basis of
               active clinical follow-up and laboratory-confirmed outcomes.
               METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study during
               the period May-July 2009 (ie, during the first wave of the pH1N1
               pandemic) in Quebec City, Canada. We assessed pH1N1 transmission
               in 42 households (including 43 primary case patients and 119
               contacts). Clinical data were prospectively collected during
               serial household visits. Secondary case patients were identified
               by clinical criteria and laboratory diagnostic tests, including
               serological and molecular methods. RESULTS: We identified 53
               laboratory-confirmed secondary case patients with pH1N1 virus
               infection, for an SAR of 45\% (95\% confidence interval [CI],
               35.6\%-53.5\%). Thirty-four (81\%) of the households had ≥1
               confirmed secondary case patient. The mean serial interval
               between onset of primary and confirmed secondary cases was 3.9
               days (median interval, 3 days). Influenza-like illness (fever and
               cough or sore throat) developed in 29\% (95\% CI, 20.5\%-36.7\%)
               of household contacts. Five (9.4\%) of secondary case patients
               were asymptomatic. Young children (<7 years of age) were at
               highest risk of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza-like
               illness. Primary case patients with both diarrhea and vomiting
               were the most likely to transmit pH1N1. CONCLUSION: Household
               transmission of pH1N1 may be substantially greater than
               previously estimated, especially in association with clinical
               presentations that include gastrointestinal complaints.

               confirmed cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) had been
               reported in the United States. Risk factors for transmission
               remain largely uncharacterized. We characterize the risk factors
               and describe the transmission of the virus within households.
               METHODS: Probable and confirmed cases of infection with the 2009
               H1N1 virus in the United States were reported to the Centers for
               Disease Control and Prevention with the use of a standardized
               case form. We investigated transmission of infection in 216
               households--including 216 index patients and their 600 household
               contacts--in which the index patient was the first case patient
               and complete information on symptoms and age was available for
               all household members. RESULTS: An acute respiratory illness
               developed in 78 of 600 household contacts (13\%). In 156
               households (72\% of the 216 households), an acute respiratory
               illness developed in none of the household contacts; in 46
               households (21\%), illness developed in one contact; and in 14
               households (6\%), illness developed in more than one contact. The
               proportion of household contacts in whom acute respiratory
               illness developed decreased with the size of the household, from
               28\% in two-member households to 9\% in six-member households.
               Household contacts 18 years of age or younger were twice as
               susceptible as those 19 to 50 years of age (relative
               susceptibility, 1.96; Bayesian 95\% credible interval, 1.05 to
               3.78; P=0.005), and household contacts older than 50 years of age
               were less susceptible than those who were 19 to 50 years of age
               (relative susceptibility, 0.17; 95\% credible interval, 0.02 to
               0.92; P=0.03). Infectivity did not vary with age. The mean time
               between the onset of symptoms in a case patient and the onset of
               symptoms in the household contacts infected by that patient was
               2.6 days (95\% credible interval, 2.2 to 3.5). CONCLUSIONS: The
               transmissibility of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in households
               is lower than that seen in past pandemics. Most transmissions
