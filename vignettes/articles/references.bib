               units (PICUs), with the objectives of describing a cohort of
               infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection,
               comparing hospital diagnosis with PCR results and investigating
               the spread of RSV in families. Eligible infants were under 5
               months old and admitted betweem November 1998 and October 1999
               with respiratory failure, apnoea and/or bradycardia or acute life
               threatening episodes (ALTE). We diagnosed RSV by PCR analysis of
               nasopharyngeal aspirate, and in contacts by PCR of pernasal
               swabs. Of the 137 eligible infants, 66\% (91/137) were recruited;
               of these, 82\% (75/91) had RSV, with 47\% (35/75) diagnosed by
               hospital laboratory tests and 93\% (70/75) by PCR. The median
               duration of ventilation was 4.4 days, the length of stay on PICU,
               8.6 days, and the length of stay in hospital, 15.9 days. In most
               families (62\%), the parents and siblings developed symptoms of
               RSV infection at the same time as the infant. When the index
               infant was a secondary case, primary cases occurred in both older
               siblings (16 families) and adults (11 families). Silent RSV
               infection occurred frequently amongst children and adults. RSV is
               under-diagnosed in PICUs. PCR increases the rate of diagnosis of
               RSV compared to routine hospital diagnostic methods. Young
               infants are most often infected at the same time as or before
               their parents and siblings, indicating that the source may be
               outside the household; vaccinating family members may not prevent
               RSV infection in infants.",

               household of infants aged 6 months admitted to the hospital for
               pertussis in the Netherlands. METHODS: During the period
               2006-2008, a total of 560 household contacts of 164 hospitalized
               infants were tested by polymerase chain reaction, culture, and
               serological examination to establish Bordetella pertussis
               infection. Clinical symptoms and vaccination history were
               obtained by a questionnaire submitted during sample collection
               and 4-6 weeks afterwards. RESULTS: Overall, 299 household
               contacts (53\%) had laboratory-confired pertussis; 159 (53\%) had
               symptoms compatible with typical pertussis infection, and 42
               (14\%) had no symptoms. Among children vaccinated with a
               whole-cell vaccine, 17 (46\%) of 37 had typical pertussis 1-3
               years after completion of the primary series, compared with 9
               (29\%) of 31 children who had been completely vaccinated with an
               acellular vaccine. For 96 households (60\%), the most likely
               source of infection of the infant was established, being a
               sibling (41\%), mother (38\%), or father (17\%). CONCLUSIONS: If
               immunity to pertussis in parents is maintained or boosted,
               35\%-55\% of infant cases could be prevented. Furthermore, we
               found that, 1-3 years after vaccination with whole-cell or
               acellular vaccine, a significant percentage of children are again
               susceptible for typical pertussis. In the long term, pertussis
               vaccines and vaccination strategies should be improved to provide
               longer protection and prevent transmission.",

              duration between symptom onset of a primary case and symptom
              onset of its secondary cases. A good evidence base for such
              values is essential, because they allow investigators to identify
              epidemiologic links between cases and serve as an important
              parameter in epidemic transmission models used to design
              infection control strategies. We reviewed the literature for
              available data sets containing serial intervals and for reported
              values of serial intervals. We were able to collect data on
              outbreaks within households, which we reanalyzed to infer a mean
              serial interval using a common statistical method. We estimated
              the mean serial intervals for influenza A(H3N2) (2.2 days),
              pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2.8 days), respiratory syncytial

              value that deviates substantially from the 21 days commonly used
              in transmission models. This value of the serial interval for
              pertussis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first that is

               renewed interest, as the vaccination of children is currently
               under debate and antiviral treatments have been approved for
               prophylactic use. AIMS: To quantify the risk factors of influenza
               transmission in households. DESIGN OF STUDY: A prospective study
               conducted during the 1999 to 2000 winter season in France.
               SETTING: Nine hundred and forty-six households where a member,
               the index patient, had visited their general practitioner (GP)
               because of an influenza-like illness were enrolled in the study.
               Five hundred and ten of the index patients tested positive for
               influenza A (subtype H3N2). A standardised daily questionnaire
               allowed for identification of secondary cases of influenza among
               their household contacts, who were followed-up for 15 days. Of
               the 395 (77\%) households that completed the questionnaire, we
               selected 279 where no additional cases had occurred on the day of
               the index patient's visit to the GP. METHODS: Secondary cases of
               influenza were those household contacts who had developed
               clinical influenza within 5 days of the disease onset in the
               index patient. Hazard ratios for individual clinical and
               demographic characteristics of the contact and their index
               patient were derived from a Cox regression model. RESULTS:
               Overall in the 279 households, 131 (24.1\%) secondary cases
               occurred among the 543 household contacts. There was an increased
               risk of influenza transmission in preschool contacts (hazard
               ratio [HR] = 1.85, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 3.26)
               as compared with school-age and adult contacts. There was also an
               increased risk in contacts exposed to preschool index patients
               (HR = 1.93, 95\% CI = 1.09 to 3.42) and school-age index patients
               (HR = 1.68, 95\% CI = 1.07 to 2.65), compared with those exposed
               to adult index cases. No other factor was associated with
               transmission of the disease. CONCLUSION: Our results support the
               major role of children in the dissemination of influenza in
               households. Vaccination of children or prophylaxis with
               neuraminidase inhibitors would prevent, respectively, 32-38\% and
               21-41\% of secondary cases caused by exposure to a sick child in
               the household.",

               Taipei. We investigated an outbreak to determine varicella
               vaccine coverage and effectiveness. METHODS: An outbreak occurred
               in an elementary school which located in southern Taipei from
               April 2007 through May 2007. A retrospect cohort study was
               performed by using a self-administered questionnaire for parents.
               RESULTS: Ten out of sixteen varicella cases were vaccinated.
               Overall vaccine coverage was 71.2\%. The common reasons for not
               receiving varicella vaccine were that varicella vaccine was
               unavailable because the student didn't live in Taipei (29.4\%) or
               the children could not be vaccinated due to certain illnesses
               (23.5\%). The sensitivity and specificity of self-reported
               vaccination status was 0.900 (95\% CI: 0.864, 0.935) and 0.611
               (95\% CI: 0.514, 0.701).The vaccine effectiveness was
               69.3\%-100.0\% against any disease severity of varicella. Overall
               vaccine effectiveness against moderate or severe varicella was
               85.5\%. Attending cram school was associated with the risk of
               developing the varicella illness (RR: 13.39; 95\% CI: 5.38,
               33.31). Unvaccinated students tended to show moderate to severe
               (>50 lesions) afflictions of the disease (RR: 4.17; 95\% CI:
               1.15, 15.14). CONCLUSIONS: Because of the low vaccination
               coverage, varicella outbreaks continue to be reported in Taipei.
               Increasing vaccine coverage and second dose vaccination for
               increasing vaccine effectiveness may be considered.",

               (CP) occurred at a child care centre in Perth, Western Australia.
               An epidemiological study was undertaken in order to determine the
               characteristics of the outbreak, assess vaccine effectiveness,
               and to define the direct and indirect costs associated with CP
               infections in young children. METHODS: A cohort study of the
               outbreak utilising attendance records and a telephone survey of
               parents was conducted. RESULTS: Of the 211 children attending the
               child care centre at the time of the outbreak, 44 contracted CP
               (attack rate 25.7\%). In addition, two staff members, five
               secondary household contacts (secondary attack rate 38.5\%) and
               four secondary non-household associated contacts were infected.
               There were no severe complications or any hospitalisations
               recorded in infected persons. Two cases had been vaccinated
               previously. Vaccine effectiveness for CP of any severity was
               78.0\% (95\% CI 15.4-94.3\%) while vaccine effectiveness against
               severe CP was 100\%. Direct costs during this outbreak were
               estimated to be $54 per case and the total costs, including cost
               of parental time off work or study, were estimated to be $525.73
               per case. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Although morbidity
               associated with CP in young children is not great, infection in
               childhood is almost universal. This study found that the average
               costs associated with each CP case were considerable. Since
               varicella vaccine affords good protection against CP, the recent
               inclusion of this vaccine in the Australian childhood vaccination
               schedule should save the community a considerable amount in
               direct and indirect costs if high coverage rates can be achieved.",

               onset (incubation period), the duration of any extra-human phase

               determining whether transmissibility differed from seasonal
               influenza viruses was a priority for decision making on
               mitigation strategies at the beginning of the pandemic. The
               objective of this study was to estimate household secondary
               attack rates for pandemic influenza in a susceptible population
               where control measures had yet to be implemented. METHODS: All
               Ontario local health units were invited to participate; seven
               health units volunteered. For all laboratory-confirmed cases
               reported between April 24 and June 18, 2009, participating health
               units performed contact tracing to detect secondary cases among
               household contacts. In total, 87 cases and 266 household contacts
               were included in this study. Secondary cases were defined as any
               household member with new onset of acute respiratory illness
               (fever or two or more respiratory symptoms) or influenza-like
               illness (fever plus one additional respiratory symptom). Attack
               rates were estimated using both case definitions. RESULTS:
               Secondary attack rates were estimated at 10.3\% (95\% CI
               6.8-14.7) for secondary cases with influenza-like illness and
               20.2\% (95\% CI 15.4-25.6) for secondary cases with acute
               respiratory illness. For both case definitions, attack rates were
               significantly higher in children under 16 years than adults
               (25.4\% and 42.4\% compared to 7.6\% and 17.2\%). The median time
               between symptom onset in the primary case and the secondary case
               was estimated at 3.0 days. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary attack rates
               for pandemic influenza A (H1N1) were comparable to seasonal
               influenza estimates suggesting similarities in transmission. High
               secondary attack rates in children provide additional support for
               increased susceptibility to infection.",

               pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus (pH1N1) is critical for the

               Our objectives were to estimate the secondary attack rates
               (SARs), the proportion of asymptomatic infections, and risk
               factors for pH1N1 transmission within households on the basis of
               active clinical follow-up and laboratory-confirmed outcomes.
               METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study during
               the period May-July 2009 (ie, during the first wave of the pH1N1
               pandemic) in Quebec City, Canada. We assessed pH1N1 transmission
               in 42 households (including 43 primary case patients and 119
               contacts). Clinical data were prospectively collected during
               serial household visits. Secondary case patients were identified
               by clinical criteria and laboratory diagnostic tests, including
               serological and molecular methods. RESULTS: We identified 53
               laboratory-confirmed secondary case patients with pH1N1 virus
               infection, for an SAR of 45\% (95\% confidence interval [CI],
               35.6\%-53.5\%). Thirty-four (81\%) of the households had ≥1
               confirmed secondary case patient. The mean serial interval
               between onset of primary and confirmed secondary cases was 3.9
               days (median interval, 3 days). Influenza-like illness (fever and
               cough or sore throat) developed in 29\% (95\% CI, 20.5\%-36.7\%)
               of household contacts. Five (9.4\%) of secondary case patients
               were asymptomatic. Young children (<7 years of age) were at
               highest risk of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza-like
               illness. Primary case patients with both diarrhea and vomiting
               were the most likely to transmit pH1N1. CONCLUSION: Household
               transmission of pH1N1 may be substantially greater than
               previously estimated, especially in association with clinical
               presentations that include gastrointestinal complaints.

               reported in the United States. Risk factors for transmission
               remain largely uncharacterized. We characterize the risk factors
               and describe the transmission of the virus within households.
               METHODS: Probable and confirmed cases of infection with the 2009
               H1N1 virus in the United States were reported to the Centers for
               Disease Control and Prevention with the use of a standardized
               case form. We investigated transmission of infection in 216
               households--including 216 index patients and their 600 household
               contacts--in which the index patient was the first case patient
               and complete information on symptoms and age was available for
               all household members. RESULTS: An acute respiratory illness
               developed in 78 of 600 household contacts (13\%). In 156
               households (72\% of the 216 households), an acute respiratory
               illness developed in none of the household contacts; in 46
               households (21\%), illness developed in one contact; and in 14
               households (6\%), illness developed in more than one contact. The
               proportion of household contacts in whom acute respiratory
               illness developed decreased with the size of the household, from
               28\% in two-member households to 9\% in six-member households.
               Household contacts 18 years of age or younger were twice as
               susceptible as those 19 to 50 years of age (relative
               susceptibility, 1.96; Bayesian 95\% credible interval, 1.05 to
               3.78; P=0.005), and household contacts older than 50 years of age
               were less susceptible than those who were 19 to 50 years of age
               (relative susceptibility, 0.17; 95\% credible interval, 0.02 to
               0.92; P=0.03). Infectivity did not vary with age. The mean time
               between the onset of symptoms in a case patient and the onset of
               symptoms in the household contacts infected by that patient was
               2.6 days (95\% credible interval, 2.2 to 3.5). CONCLUSIONS: The
               transmissibility of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in households
               is lower than that seen in past pandemics. Most transmissions

               reproduction number [Formula: see text] is a time-varying
               parameter defined as the average number of secondary infections
               generated by an infected individual at time t. It is therefore a
               crucial epidemiological statistic that assists public health
               decision makers in the management of an epidemic. We present a
               new Bayesian tool (EpiLPS) for robust estimation of the
               time-varying reproduction number. The proposed methodology
               smooths the epidemic curve and allows to obtain (approximate)
               point estimates and credible intervals of [Formula: see text] by
               employing the renewal equation, using Bayesian P-splines coupled
               with Laplace approximations of the conditional posterior of the
               spline vector. Two alternative approaches for inference are
               presented: (1) an approach based on a maximum a posteriori
               argument for the model hyperparameters, delivering estimates of
               [Formula: see text] in only a few seconds; and (2) an approach
               based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme with underlying
               Langevin dynamics for efficient sampling of the posterior target
               distribution. Case counts per unit of time are assumed to follow
               a negative binomial distribution to account for potential
               overdispersion in the data that would not be captured by a
               classic Poisson model. Furthermore, after smoothing the epidemic
               curve, a ``plug-in'' estimate of the reproduction number can be
               obtained from the renewal equation yielding a closed form
               expression of [Formula: see text] as a function of the spline
               parameters. The approach is extremely fast and free of arbitrary
               smoothing assumptions. EpiLPS is applied on data of SARS-CoV-1 in
               Hong-Kong (2003), influenza A H1N1 (2009) in the USA and on the

               Transmissibility can be measured by the reproduction number R,
               the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected
               individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over
               the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to
               implement for people without a strong background in statistical
               modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R
               from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular
               software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation,
               Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically
               robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in
               the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the
               onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in
               secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical
               outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those
               presented in the literature. This tool should help
               epidemiologists quantify temporal changes in the transmission
               intensity of future epidemics by using surveillance data.",

               for detecting changes in disease transmission over time. During
               the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, policy makers
               and public health officials are using Rt to assess the
               effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However,
               estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges,
               with critical implications for the interpretation of the course
               of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize
               these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic
               data, and, where possible, make recommendations. For near
               real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori and
               colleagues, which uses data from before time t and empirical
               estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods
               that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis,
               are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near
               real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for retrospective
               analyses of how individuals infected at different time points
               contributed to the spread. We advise caution when using methods
               derived from the approach of Bettencourt and Ribeiro, as the
               resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural
               assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all
               approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval
               and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from
               observations occurring long after the moment of transmission.
               Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as
               subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce
               bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other
               technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt

              management tools in planning for the control of emerging
              infectious diseases. A key variable in such models is the
              reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the
              value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly
              from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such
              inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that
              relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is
              unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection.
              Here, we show that these different equations differ only with
              respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval
              distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval
              distribution determines which equation is appropriate for
              inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate.
              We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to
              the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values
              that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate.
              Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval

              following the daily routine in the kindergarten. A total of 16

              in nursery teachers (risk ratio 42.1) compared to children (risk
              ratio 10.5). In all cases, scabies had developed rather recently,
              with minimal clinical manifestations. In nursery teachers, the
              probability of scabies was 4.4 times higher in those teachers who
              hugged children regularly. Children who preferably played with

              in The Hague was notified of a new scabies outbreak in a nursing
              home in that region. The PHS initiated an outbreak investigation.
              Cases were defined as: possible (reported symptoms), probable
              (scabies-like lesions) and confirmed (PCR or microscopy in skin
              flakes). Head-to-toe examinations were performed of all residents
              and those staff members who reported symptoms suggestive of
              scabies. Skin scrapings of lesions were tested either with
              microscopy or by PCR. Experimentally for case finding, skin
              flakes from bed linens of residents who reported symptoms of
              itchiness but did not have primary lesions were sent for PCR
              testing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All residents (41) and 37/44 staff
              were included in this outbreak investigation. We identified 30
              possible, four probable and six confirmed cases. The overall
              attack rate for probable/confirmed cases was 10/78 (13\%). Of the
              six confirmed cases, two were confirmed by PCR, three by
              microscopy, and one showed positive findings with both
              techniques. Two out of the three bed-linen specimens were
              PCR-positive. CONCLUSIONS: In this outbreak of scabies in a
              nursing home, PCR was used on skin flakes from bed linens, which
              led to the detection of two additional cases. This illustrates

              assess the scope of the outbreak, identify associated factors, and
              recommend interventions. Methods: We defined a suspected scabies
              case as the onset of an itchy pimple-like skin rash or crusting
              from January 2021 to July 2022 in a resident of Hoima District. We
              reviewed medical records, performed active community case-finding,
              and computed attack rates by age, sex, and village per 1,000
              population. Using logistic regression, we compared exposures among
              101 case persons and 99 unmatched controls living in Rwentale
              Landing Site in Hoima during June 2022. Results: We line listed
              2,236 suspected cases in Hoima District. Children aged 5–14 years

              interactions. Community sensitization on scabies, especially
              before fishing and trading seasons is recommended for prevention
              and early control of scabies in the region. Additionally,
              establishing a surveillance system for scabies, in high-risk areas

              at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, the nationwide prevalence of
              scabies is unknown. Overall, its burden is higher in tropical
              regions. Scabies outbreaks mostly occur among children, the
              elderly in nursing homes, and prison inmates. Even though primary
              scabies hardly results in mortalities, the pain, itch, and
              systemic complications from secondary bacterial infections
              account for about 1.5 million years lived with disabilities. We
              investigated a scabies outbreak among school children in Ghana to
              determine its magnitude, stop the outbreak, and institute
              preventive measures to minimize risks of future outbreaks.
              METHODS: The investigation was conducted between March 14 and May
              17, 2017 among pupils of Presbyterian Secondary Staff Basic
              School in Accra. We defined a case as a school child who on
              clinical examination, had an intensely pruritic rash on at least
              one typical predilection site with or without a burrow, or
              positive skin scrapings on microscopy. We screened and line
              listed cases, performed laboratory investigations on skin
              scrapings and wound swaps, and conducted an environmental
              assessment. We performed descriptive statistics on data, and
              calculated attack rate ratios (ARR) at 95\% confidence level.
              RESULTS: Of 823 preschool children screened, 92 were cases.
              Median age of cases was 4 years (range 2-7 years) and their modal
              age was 3 years. The overall attack rate was 11.2\% (92/823). The
              sex specific attack rate was 11.5\% for males, and 10.8\% for
              females (ARR: 0.93; CI: 0.67-1.28). Compared with the least
              affected class (cr{\`e}che), the nursery one class was worst
              affected (ARR: 5.14; CI: 3.44-7.50). On microscopy, all skin

              Streptococcus spp. were isolated from secondarily infected
              scabies lesions. CONCLUSIONS: A scabies outbreak with a
              propagated source occurred among preschool children. The
              3-year-old pupils were most affected. It was controlled by mass
              treatment with benzyl benzoate and health education. Classrooms
              and sleeping mats were disinfected. We recommended the
