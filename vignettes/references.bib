               practitioners in the Netherlands observed an increase in scabies
               in the Netherlands. Since individual cases of scabies are not
               notifiable in the Netherlands, the epidemiological situation is
               mostly unknown. To investigate the scabies incidence in the
               Netherlands, we described the epidemiology of scabies between
               2011 and 2021. METHODS: Two national data sources were analysed
               descriptively. One data source obtained incidence data of scabies
               (per 1,000 persons) of persons consulting in primary care from
               2011-2020. The other data source captured the number of
               prescribed scabicides in the Netherlands from 2011-2021. To
               describe the correlation between the incidence of diagnoses and
               the number of dispensations between 2011 and 2020, we calculated
               a correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The incidence of reported
               scabies has increased by more than threefold the last decade
               (2011-2020), mainly affecting adolescents and (young) adults.
               This was also clearly reflected in the fivefold increase in
               dispensations of scabicide medication during 2011-2021. The
               incidence and dispensations were at an all-time high in 2021. We
               found a strong correlation between the reported incidence and the
               number of dispensations between 2011 and 2020. CONCLUSIONS: More
               awareness on early diagnosis, proper treatment and treatment of
               close contacts is needed.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Scabies is a neglected disease stablished worldwide
              with a fairy well determined incidence. In high-income countries,
              it often causes outbreaks affecting the residents and staff of
              institutions and long-term facilities, usually hard to detect and
              control due to the difficult diagnosis and notification delay.
              This study aim at characterizing the affected population,
              geographical distribution, and evolution of scabies in Spain from
              1997-2019 as well as to describe the main environments of
              transmission using different data sources. METHODS: We carried
              out a nationwide retrospective study using four databases, which
              record data from different perspectives: hospital admissions,
              patients attended at primary healthcare services, outbreaks, and
              occupational diseases. We described the main characteristics from
              each database and calculated annual incidences in order to
              evaluate temporal and geographical patterns. We also analyzed
              outbreaks and occupational settings to characterize the main
              transmission foci and applied Joinpoint regression models to
              detect trend changes. RESULTS: The elderly was the most frequent
              collective among the hospital admitted patients and notified
              cases in outbreaks, while children and young adults were the most
              affected according to primary care databases. The majority of the
              outbreaks occurred in homes and nursing homes; however, the
              facilities with more cases per outbreak were military barracks,
              healthcare settings and nursing homes. Most occupational cases
              occurred also in healthcare and social services settings, being
              healthcare workers the most common affected professional group.
              We detected a decreasing trend in scabies admissions from 1997 to
              2014 (annual percentage change -APC- = -11.2\%) and an increasing
              trend from 2014 to 2017 (APC = 23.6\%). Wide geographical
              differences were observed depending on the database explored.
              DISCUSSION: An increasing trend in scabies admissions was
              observed in Spain since 2014, probably due to cutbacks in social
              services and healthcare in addition to worsen of living
              conditions as a result of the 2008 economic crisis, among other
              reasons. The main transmission foci were healthcare and social
              settings. Measures including enhancing epidemic studies and
              national registries, reinforcing clinical diagnosis and early
              detection of cases, hygiene improvements and training of the
              staff and wide implementation of scabies treatment (considering
              mass drug administration in institutions outbreaks) should be
              considered to reduce the impact of scabies among most vulnerable
              groups in Spain.",

              related factors. METHODS: This mixed ecological study is based on
              a retrospective medical record review. National data from
              communicable disease reports was sourced and analysed for an
              11-year period (2007-2017), with more focus on the period
              2014-2017. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate trends.
              Differences between the groups were studied using Chi-square test
              and Kendall's tau ($\tau$) correlation coefficient. Levels of
              significance were set at p<0.05 or p<0.01. RESULTS: From 2007 to
              2017, scabies infestation in Croatia increased by 6-fold,
              particularly affecting children and young adults (19 years or
              younger). In the period 2014-2017, border counties which are part
              of migration flows were the counties with the highest average
              scabies incidences. A linear trend of increase in the number of
              tourists, immigrants and scabies infestations was noted on the
              national level for the analysed period, although a significant
              association was not observed. Regarding outbreaks of scabies
              within institutions, more than 80\% of outbreaks occurred in
              institutions for adults. In the capital, Zagreb, the crude
              incidence rate increased 3-fold between 2014 and 2017.
              CONCLUSIONS: The increased incidence of scabies, large
              disparities between counties, and prolonged outbreaks within
              families due to under-recognition and misdiagnoses points to a
              need for increased awareness among health practitioners. To the
              best of our knowledge, this is the first recent epidemiologic

              to demonstrate the likely effectiveness of MDA recommendations.
              In this study, we developed an agent-based model of scabies
              transmission calibrated to demographic and epidemiological data
              from Monrovia. We used this model to compare the effectiveness of
              MDA scenarios for achieving scabies elimination and reducing
              scabies burden, as measured by time until recrudescence following
              delivery of an MDA and disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs)

              six-month intervals and reaching 80\% of the population could
              reduce prevalence below 2\% for three years following the final
              round, before recrudescence. When MDAs were followed by increased

              has been used in such settings to achieve a rapid reduction in
              infection and transmission, with the goal of eliminating the
              public health burden of scabies. While prevalence has been
              observed to fall substantially following such an intervention, in
              some instances resurgence of infection to baseline levels has
              occurred over several years. To explore the biology underpinning
              this phenomenon, we have developed a theoretical model of scabies
              life-cycle and transmission dynamics in a homogeneously mixing
              population, and simulate the impact of mass drug treatment
              strategies acting on egg and mite life cycle stages (ovicidal) or
              mites alone (non-ovicidal). In order to investigate the dynamics
              of the system, we first define and calculate the optimal interval
              between treatment doses. We calculate the probability of
              eradication as a function of the number of optimally-timed
              successive treatment doses and the number of years over which a
              program is run. For the non-ovicidal intervention, we first show
              that at least two optimally-timed doses are required to achieve
              eradication. We then demonstrate that while more doses over a
              small number of years provides the highest chance of eradication,
              a similar outcome can be achieved with fewer doses delivered
              annually over a longer period of time. For the ovicidal
              intervention, we find that doses should be delivered as close
              together as possible. This work provides a platform for further
              research into optimal treatment strategies which may incorporate
              heterogeneity of transmission, and the interplay between MDA and

              well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential
              care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient
              interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases.
              Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient
              solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations
              that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random

              select the most appropriate of these methods to perform inference
