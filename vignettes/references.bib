               practitioners in the Netherlands observed an increase in scabies
               in the Netherlands. Since individual cases of scabies are not
               notifiable in the Netherlands, the epidemiological situation is
               mostly unknown. To investigate the scabies incidence in the
               Netherlands, we described the epidemiology of scabies between
               2011 and 2021. METHODS: Two national data sources were analysed
               descriptively. One data source obtained incidence data of scabies
               (per 1,000 persons) of persons consulting in primary care from
               2011-2020. The other data source captured the number of
               prescribed scabicides in the Netherlands from 2011-2021. To
               describe the correlation between the incidence of diagnoses and
               the number of dispensations between 2011 and 2020, we calculated
               a correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The incidence of reported
               scabies has increased by more than threefold the last decade
               (2011-2020), mainly affecting adolescents and (young) adults.
               This was also clearly reflected in the fivefold increase in
               dispensations of scabicide medication during 2011-2021. The
               incidence and dispensations were at an all-time high in 2021. We
               found a strong correlation between the reported incidence and the
               number of dispensations between 2011 and 2020. CONCLUSIONS: More
               awareness on early diagnosis, proper treatment and treatment of
               close contacts is needed.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Scabies is a neglected disease stablished worldwide
              with a fairy well determined incidence. In high-income countries,
              it often causes outbreaks affecting the residents and staff of
              institutions and long-term facilities, usually hard to detect and
              control due to the difficult diagnosis and notification delay.
              This study aim at characterizing the affected population,
              geographical distribution, and evolution of scabies in Spain from
              1997-2019 as well as to describe the main environments of
              transmission using different data sources. METHODS: We carried
              out a nationwide retrospective study using four databases, which
              record data from different perspectives: hospital admissions,
              patients attended at primary healthcare services, outbreaks, and
              occupational diseases. We described the main characteristics from
              each database and calculated annual incidences in order to
              evaluate temporal and geographical patterns. We also analyzed
              outbreaks and occupational settings to characterize the main
              transmission foci and applied Joinpoint regression models to
              detect trend changes. RESULTS: The elderly was the most frequent
              collective among the hospital admitted patients and notified
              cases in outbreaks, while children and young adults were the most
              affected according to primary care databases. The majority of the
              outbreaks occurred in homes and nursing homes; however, the
              facilities with more cases per outbreak were military barracks,
              healthcare settings and nursing homes. Most occupational cases
              occurred also in healthcare and social services settings, being
              healthcare workers the most common affected professional group.
              We detected a decreasing trend in scabies admissions from 1997 to
              2014 (annual percentage change -APC- = -11.2\%) and an increasing
              trend from 2014 to 2017 (APC = 23.6\%). Wide geographical
              differences were observed depending on the database explored.
              DISCUSSION: An increasing trend in scabies admissions was
              observed in Spain since 2014, probably due to cutbacks in social
              services and healthcare in addition to worsen of living
              conditions as a result of the 2008 economic crisis, among other
              reasons. The main transmission foci were healthcare and social
              settings. Measures including enhancing epidemic studies and
              national registries, reinforcing clinical diagnosis and early
              detection of cases, hygiene improvements and training of the
              staff and wide implementation of scabies treatment (considering
              mass drug administration in institutions outbreaks) should be
              considered to reduce the impact of scabies among most vulnerable
              groups in Spain.",

              incidence in the Croatian population and to analyse potential
              related factors. METHODS: This mixed ecological study is based on
              a retrospective medical record review. National data from
              communicable disease reports was sourced and analysed for an
              11-year period (2007-2017), with more focus on the period
              2014-2017. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate trends.
              Differences between the groups were studied using Chi-square test
              and Kendall's tau ($\tau$) correlation coefficient. Levels of
              significance were set at p<0.05 or p<0.01. RESULTS: From 2007 to
              2017, scabies infestation in Croatia increased by 6-fold,
              particularly affecting children and young adults (19 years or
              younger). In the period 2014-2017, border counties which are part
              of migration flows were the counties with the highest average
              scabies incidences. A linear trend of increase in the number of
              tourists, immigrants and scabies infestations was noted on the
              national level for the analysed period, although a significant
              association was not observed. Regarding outbreaks of scabies
              within institutions, more than 80\% of outbreaks occurred in
              institutions for adults. In the capital, Zagreb, the crude
              incidence rate increased 3-fold between 2014 and 2017.
              CONCLUSIONS: The increased incidence of scabies, large
              disparities between counties, and prolonged outbreaks within
              families due to under-recognition and misdiagnoses points to a
              need for increased awareness among health practitioners. To the
              best of our knowledge, this is the first recent epidemiologic

              to demonstrate the likely effectiveness of MDA recommendations.
              In this study, we developed an agent-based model of scabies
              transmission calibrated to demographic and epidemiological data
              from Monrovia. We used this model to compare the effectiveness of
              MDA scenarios for achieving scabies elimination and reducing
              scabies burden, as measured by time until recrudescence following
              delivery of an MDA and disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs)
              averted. Our model showed that three rounds of MDA delivered at
              six-month intervals and reaching 80\% of the population could
              reduce prevalence below 2\% for three years following the final
              round, before recrudescence. When MDAs were followed by increased

              has been used in such settings to achieve a rapid reduction in
              infection and transmission, with the goal of eliminating the
              public health burden of scabies. While prevalence has been
              observed to fall substantially following such an intervention, in
              some instances resurgence of infection to baseline levels has
              occurred over several years. To explore the biology underpinning
              this phenomenon, we have developed a theoretical model of scabies
              life-cycle and transmission dynamics in a homogeneously mixing
              population, and simulate the impact of mass drug treatment
              strategies acting on egg and mite life cycle stages (ovicidal) or
              mites alone (non-ovicidal). In order to investigate the dynamics
              of the system, we first define and calculate the optimal interval
              between treatment doses. We calculate the probability of
              eradication as a function of the number of optimally-timed
              successive treatment doses and the number of years over which a
              program is run. For the non-ovicidal intervention, we first show
              that at least two optimally-timed doses are required to achieve
              eradication. We then demonstrate that while more doses over a
              small number of years provides the highest chance of eradication,
              a similar outcome can be achieved with fewer doses delivered
              annually over a longer period of time. For the ovicidal
              intervention, we find that doses should be delivered as close
              together as possible. This work provides a platform for further
              research into optimal treatment strategies which may incorporate

              well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential
              care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient
              interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases.
              Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient
              solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations
              that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random
              models to real data on scabies in residential care homes. In
              particular, we review and benchmark different numerical methods

              select the most appropriate of these methods to perform inference

              or via fomites were assessed using questionnaires and by
              following the daily routine in the kindergarten. A total of 16
              cases were identified. The attack rate was significantly higher
              in nursery teachers (risk ratio 42.1) compared to children (risk
              ratio 10.5). In all cases, scabies had developed rather recently,
              with minimal clinical manifestations. In nursery teachers, the
              probability of scabies was 4.4 times higher in those teachers who
              hugged children regularly. Children who preferably played with
              their own soft toys had a lower probability of developing scabies
              [risk ratio 0.14, 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.05-0.42; p =
              0.04]. It seems conceivable that the particular pedagogical
              concept of the kindergarten favored the spread of Sarcoptes
              mites. We were unable to show whether transmission had preferably
              occurred through body contact or via fomites.",

              Netherlands. In October 2018, a local public health service (PHS)
              in The Hague was notified of a new scabies outbreak in a nursing
              home in that region. The PHS initiated an outbreak investigation.
              Cases were defined as: possible (reported symptoms), probable
              (scabies-like lesions) and confirmed (PCR or microscopy in skin
              flakes). Head-to-toe examinations were performed of all residents
              and those staff members who reported symptoms suggestive of
              scabies. Skin scrapings of lesions were tested either with
              microscopy or by PCR. Experimentally for case finding, skin
              flakes from bed linens of residents who reported symptoms of
              itchiness but did not have primary lesions were sent for PCR
              testing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All residents (41) and 37/44 staff
              were included in this outbreak investigation. We identified 30
              possible, four probable and six confirmed cases. The overall
              attack rate for probable/confirmed cases was 10/78 (13\%). Of the
              six confirmed cases, two were confirmed by PCR, three by
              microscopy, and one showed positive findings with both
              techniques. Two out of the three bed-linen specimens were
              PCR-positive. CONCLUSIONS: In this outbreak of scabies in a
              nursing home, PCR was used on skin flakes from bed linens, which
              led to the detection of two additional cases. This illustrates

              0.3 and 46.0\%. In Ghana, even though a 5.1\% proportion of
              scabies was reported in a retrospective review of skin diseases
              at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, the nationwide prevalence of
              scabies is unknown. Overall, its burden is higher in tropical
              regions. Scabies outbreaks mostly occur among children, the
              elderly in nursing homes, and prison inmates. Even though primary
              scabies hardly results in mortalities, the pain, itch, and
              systemic complications from secondary bacterial infections
              account for about 1.5 million years lived with disabilities. We
              investigated a scabies outbreak among school children in Ghana to
              determine its magnitude, stop the outbreak, and institute
              preventive measures to minimize risks of future outbreaks.
              METHODS: The investigation was conducted between March 14 and May
              17, 2017 among pupils of Presbyterian Secondary Staff Basic
              School in Accra. We defined a case as a school child who on
              clinical examination, had an intensely pruritic rash on at least
              one typical predilection site with or without a burrow, or
              positive skin scrapings on microscopy. We screened and line
              listed cases, performed laboratory investigations on skin
              scrapings and wound swaps, and conducted an environmental
              assessment. We performed descriptive statistics on data, and
              calculated attack rate ratios (ARR) at 95\% confidence level.
              RESULTS: Of 823 preschool children screened, 92 were cases.
              Median age of cases was 4 years (range 2-7 years) and their modal
              age was 3 years. The overall attack rate was 11.2\% (92/823). The
              sex specific attack rate was 11.5\% for males, and 10.8\% for
              females (ARR: 0.93; CI: 0.67-1.28). Compared with the least
              affected class (cr{\`e}che), the nursery one class was worst
              affected (ARR: 5.14; CI: 3.44-7.50). On microscopy, all skin
              scrapings were negative for scabies. Staphylococcus aureus and
              Streptococcus spp. were isolated from secondarily infected
              scabies lesions. CONCLUSIONS: A scabies outbreak with a
              propagated source occurred among preschool children. The
              3-year-old pupils were most affected. It was controlled by mass
              treatment with benzyl benzoate and health education. Classrooms
              and sleeping mats were disinfected. We recommended the

              outbreaks started almost simultaneously and similar control
              measures were implemented at the same time. The authors developed

              epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction

              available data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong,
              Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective
              reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various

              management tools in planning for the control of emerging
              infectious diseases. A key variable in such models is the
              reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the
              value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly
              from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such
              inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that
              relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is
              unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection.
              Here, we show that these different equations differ only with
              respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval
              distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval
              distribution determines which equation is appropriate for
              inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate.
              We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to
              the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible
              values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth

               The young, newly fertilized adult female Sarcoptes is the stage
               usually responsible for transmission.3. Patients with a high
               parasite rate (over 100 adult female mites) are much more likely
               to spread scabies than those with few parasites.4. The
               distribution of the parasites in clinical scabies gives no clue
               to the original sites of infection.5. When a volunteer is
               infected for the first time he gives no reaction for about a
               month. During this period he may be quite unaware that the
               parasites are burrowing in his cuticle.6. After a month the
               patient becomes sensitized, itching and other symptoms develop.7.
               In a first infection the mites increase in numbers far less
               rapidly than is theoretically possible. A parasite rate of about
               25 may be reached in 50 days and of up to 500 in 100 days; after
               this the number of mites decreases rapidly.8. The second time an
               individual has scabies he itches at the sites of infection within
               24 hr. His mite population seldom rises to a fraction of the
               height reached in his first infection.9. Reinfection of cured
               cases is much more difficult than infection for the first
               time.10. Sarcoptes causes antibody function in man. This causes a
               partial immunity.11. The mechanism of immunity is due to three
               reactions: (a) scratching by the host which removes the parasites
