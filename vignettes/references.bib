               practitioners in the Netherlands observed an increase in scabies
               in the Netherlands. Since individual cases of scabies are not
               notifiable in the Netherlands, the epidemiological situation is
               mostly unknown. To investigate the scabies incidence in the
               Netherlands, we described the epidemiology of scabies between
               2011 and 2021. METHODS: Two national data sources were analysed
               descriptively. One data source obtained incidence data of scabies
               (per 1,000 persons) of persons consulting in primary care from
               2011-2020. The other data source captured the number of
               prescribed scabicides in the Netherlands from 2011-2021. To
               describe the correlation between the incidence of diagnoses and
               the number of dispensations between 2011 and 2020, we calculated
               a correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The incidence of reported
               scabies has increased by more than threefold the last decade
               (2011-2020), mainly affecting adolescents and (young) adults.
               This was also clearly reflected in the fivefold increase in
               dispensations of scabicide medication during 2011-2021. The
               incidence and dispensations were at an all-time high in 2021. We
               found a strong correlation between the reported incidence and the
               number of dispensations between 2011 and 2020. CONCLUSIONS: More
               awareness on early diagnosis, proper treatment and treatment of

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Scabies is a neglected disease stablished worldwide
              with a fairy well determined incidence. In high-income countries,
              it often causes outbreaks affecting the residents and staff of
              institutions and long-term facilities, usually hard to detect and
              control due to the difficult diagnosis and notification delay.
              This study aim at characterizing the affected population,
              geographical distribution, and evolution of scabies in Spain from
              1997-2019 as well as to describe the main environments of
              transmission using different data sources. METHODS: We carried
              out a nationwide retrospective study using four databases, which
              record data from different perspectives: hospital admissions,
              patients attended at primary healthcare services, outbreaks, and
              occupational diseases. We described the main characteristics from
              each database and calculated annual incidences in order to
              evaluate temporal and geographical patterns. We also analyzed
              outbreaks and occupational settings to characterize the main
              transmission foci and applied Joinpoint regression models to
              detect trend changes. RESULTS: The elderly was the most frequent
              collective among the hospital admitted patients and notified
              cases in outbreaks, while children and young adults were the most
              affected according to primary care databases. The majority of the
              outbreaks occurred in homes and nursing homes; however, the
              facilities with more cases per outbreak were military barracks,
              healthcare settings and nursing homes. Most occupational cases
              occurred also in healthcare and social services settings, being
              healthcare workers the most common affected professional group.
              We detected a decreasing trend in scabies admissions from 1997 to
              2014 (annual percentage change -APC- = -11.2\%) and an increasing
              trend from 2014 to 2017 (APC = 23.6\%). Wide geographical
              differences were observed depending on the database explored.
              DISCUSSION: An increasing trend in scabies admissions was
              observed in Spain since 2014, probably due to cutbacks in social
              services and healthcare in addition to worsen of living
              conditions as a result of the 2008 economic crisis, among other
              reasons. The main transmission foci were healthcare and social
              settings. Measures including enhancing epidemic studies and
              national registries, reinforcing clinical diagnosis and early
              detection of cases, hygiene improvements and training of the
              staff and wide implementation of scabies treatment (considering
              mass drug administration in institutions outbreaks) should be
              considered to reduce the impact of scabies among most vulnerable
              groups in Spain.",

              incidence in the Croatian population and to analyse potential
              related factors. METHODS: This mixed ecological study is based on
              a retrospective medical record review. National data from
              communicable disease reports was sourced and analysed for an
              11-year period (2007-2017), with more focus on the period
              2014-2017. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate trends.
              Differences between the groups were studied using Chi-square test
              and Kendall's tau ($\tau$) correlation coefficient. Levels of
              significance were set at p<0.05 or p<0.01. RESULTS: From 2007 to
              2017, scabies infestation in Croatia increased by 6-fold,
              particularly affecting children and young adults (19 years or
              younger). In the period 2014-2017, border counties which are part
              of migration flows were the counties with the highest average
              scabies incidences. A linear trend of increase in the number of
              tourists, immigrants and scabies infestations was noted on the
              national level for the analysed period, although a significant
              association was not observed. Regarding outbreaks of scabies
              within institutions, more than 80\% of outbreaks occurred in
              institutions for adults. In the capital, Zagreb, the crude
              incidence rate increased 3-fold between 2014 and 2017.
              CONCLUSIONS: The increased incidence of scabies, large
              disparities between counties, and prolonged outbreaks within
              families due to under-recognition and misdiagnoses points to a
              need for increased awareness among health practitioners. To the
              best of our knowledge, this is the first recent epidemiologic

              to demonstrate the likely effectiveness of MDA recommendations.
              In this study, we developed an agent-based model of scabies
              transmission calibrated to demographic and epidemiological data
              from Monrovia. We used this model to compare the effectiveness of
              MDA scenarios for achieving scabies elimination and reducing
              scabies burden, as measured by time until recrudescence following
              delivery of an MDA and disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs)
              averted. Our model showed that three rounds of MDA delivered at
              six-month intervals and reaching 80\% of the population could
              reduce prevalence below 2\% for three years following the final
              round, before recrudescence. When MDAs were followed by increased

              has been used in such settings to achieve a rapid reduction in
              infection and transmission, with the goal of eliminating the
              public health burden of scabies. While prevalence has been
              observed to fall substantially following such an intervention, in
              some instances resurgence of infection to baseline levels has
              occurred over several years. To explore the biology underpinning
              this phenomenon, we have developed a theoretical model of scabies
              life-cycle and transmission dynamics in a homogeneously mixing
              population, and simulate the impact of mass drug treatment
              strategies acting on egg and mite life cycle stages (ovicidal) or
              mites alone (non-ovicidal). In order to investigate the dynamics
              of the system, we first define and calculate the optimal interval
              between treatment doses. We calculate the probability of
              eradication as a function of the number of optimally-timed
              successive treatment doses and the number of years over which a
              program is run. For the non-ovicidal intervention, we first show
              that at least two optimally-timed doses are required to achieve
              eradication. We then demonstrate that while more doses over a
              small number of years provides the highest chance of eradication,
              a similar outcome can be achieved with fewer doses delivered
              annually over a longer period of time. For the ovicidal
              intervention, we find that doses should be delivered as close
              together as possible. This work provides a platform for further
              research into optimal treatment strategies which may incorporate
              heterogeneity of transmission, and the interplay between MDA and

              well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential
              care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient
              interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases.
              Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient
              solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations
              that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random
              models to real data on scabies in residential care homes. In
              particular, we review and benchmark different numerical methods
              for the integration of the differential equation system, and then
              select the most appropriate of these methods to perform inference

              elderly people. Outbreaks of scabies in a kindergarten are very
              rare. The main goal of our study was to investigate an outbreak
              of scabies in a kindergarten and to identify risk factors for the
              infestation with the ectoparasitosis. We investigated an outbreak
              of scabies in a kindergarten in the City of Constance, southern
              Germany, with a particular pedagogical concept. Risk factors
              indicating a transmission of Sarcoptes mites through body contact
              or via fomites were assessed using questionnaires and by
              following the daily routine in the kindergarten. A total of 16
              cases were identified. The attack rate was significantly higher
              in nursery teachers (risk ratio 42.1) compared to children (risk
              ratio 10.5). In all cases, scabies had developed rather recently,
              with minimal clinical manifestations. In nursery teachers, the
              probability of scabies was 4.4 times higher in those teachers who
              hugged children regularly. Children who preferably played with
              their own soft toys had a lower probability of developing scabies
              [risk ratio 0.14, 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.05-0.42; p =
              0.04]. It seems conceivable that the particular pedagogical
              concept of the kindergarten favored the spread of Sarcoptes
              mites. We were unable to show whether transmission had preferably

              in The Hague was notified of a new scabies outbreak in a nursing
              home in that region. The PHS initiated an outbreak investigation.
              Cases were defined as: possible (reported symptoms), probable
              (scabies-like lesions) and confirmed (PCR or microscopy in skin
              flakes). Head-to-toe examinations were performed of all residents
              and those staff members who reported symptoms suggestive of
              scabies. Skin scrapings of lesions were tested either with
              microscopy or by PCR. Experimentally for case finding, skin
              flakes from bed linens of residents who reported symptoms of
              itchiness but did not have primary lesions were sent for PCR
              testing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All residents (41) and 37/44 staff
              were included in this outbreak investigation. We identified 30
              possible, four probable and six confirmed cases. The overall
              attack rate for probable/confirmed cases was 10/78 (13\%). Of the
              six confirmed cases, two were confirmed by PCR, three by
              microscopy, and one showed positive findings with both
              techniques. Two out of the three bed-linen specimens were
              PCR-positive. CONCLUSIONS: In this outbreak of scabies in a
              nursing home, PCR was used on skin flakes from bed linens, which
              led to the detection of two additional cases. This illustrates
              the potential of PCR during the investigation of scabies

              assess the scope of the outbreak, identify associated factors, and
              recommend interventions. Methods: We defined a suspected scabies
              case as the onset of an itchy pimple-like skin rash or crusting
              from January 2021 to July 2022 in a resident of Hoima District. We
              reviewed medical records, performed active community case-finding,
              and computed attack rates by age, sex, and village per 1,000
              population. Using logistic regression, we compared exposures among
              101 case persons and 99 unmatched controls living in Rwentale
              Landing Site in Hoima during June 2022. Results: We line listed
              2,236 suspected cases in Hoima District. Children aged 5–14 years

              initiated by person-to-person interactions during peak fishing and
              trading months at a landing site and propagated by close household
              interactions. Community sensitization on scabies, especially
              before fishing and trading seasons is recommended for prevention
              and early control of scabies in the region. Additionally,
              establishing a surveillance system for scabies, in high-risk areas
              such as fishing communities may facilitate timely detection and

              0.3 and 46.0\%. In Ghana, even though a 5.1\% proportion of
              scabies was reported in a retrospective review of skin diseases
              at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, the nationwide prevalence of
              scabies is unknown. Overall, its burden is higher in tropical
              regions. Scabies outbreaks mostly occur among children, the
              elderly in nursing homes, and prison inmates. Even though primary
              scabies hardly results in mortalities, the pain, itch, and
              systemic complications from secondary bacterial infections
              account for about 1.5 million years lived with disabilities. We
              investigated a scabies outbreak among school children in Ghana to
              determine its magnitude, stop the outbreak, and institute
              preventive measures to minimize risks of future outbreaks.
              METHODS: The investigation was conducted between March 14 and May
              17, 2017 among pupils of Presbyterian Secondary Staff Basic
              School in Accra. We defined a case as a school child who on
              clinical examination, had an intensely pruritic rash on at least
              one typical predilection site with or without a burrow, or
              positive skin scrapings on microscopy. We screened and line
              listed cases, performed laboratory investigations on skin
              scrapings and wound swaps, and conducted an environmental
              assessment. We performed descriptive statistics on data, and
              calculated attack rate ratios (ARR) at 95\% confidence level.
              RESULTS: Of 823 preschool children screened, 92 were cases.
              Median age of cases was 4 years (range 2-7 years) and their modal
              age was 3 years. The overall attack rate was 11.2\% (92/823). The
              sex specific attack rate was 11.5\% for males, and 10.8\% for
              females (ARR: 0.93; CI: 0.67-1.28). Compared with the least
              affected class (cr{\`e}che), the nursery one class was worst
              affected (ARR: 5.14; CI: 3.44-7.50). On microscopy, all skin
              scrapings were negative for scabies. Staphylococcus aureus and
              Streptococcus spp. were isolated from secondarily infected
              scabies lesions. CONCLUSIONS: A scabies outbreak with a
              propagated source occurred among preschool children. The
              3-year-old pupils were most affected. It was controlled by mass
              treatment with benzyl benzoate and health education. Classrooms
              and sleeping mats were disinfected. We recommended the

              outbreaks started almost simultaneously and similar control
              measures were implemented at the same time. The authors developed

              epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction

              available data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong,
              Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective
              reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various

              management tools in planning for the control of emerging
              infectious diseases. A key variable in such models is the
              reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the
              value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly
              from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such
              inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that
              relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is
              unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection.
              Here, we show that these different equations differ only with
              respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval
              distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval
              distribution determines which equation is appropriate for
              inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate.
              We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to

              values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth

               The young, newly fertilized adult female Sarcoptes is the stage
               usually responsible for transmission.3. Patients with a high
               parasite rate (over 100 adult female mites) are much more likely
               to spread scabies than those with few parasites.4. The
               distribution of the parasites in clinical scabies gives no clue
               to the original sites of infection.5. When a volunteer is
               infected for the first time he gives no reaction for about a
               month. During this period he may be quite unaware that the
               parasites are burrowing in his cuticle.6. After a month the
               patient becomes sensitized, itching and other symptoms develop.7.
               In a first infection the mites increase in numbers far less
               rapidly than is theoretically possible. A parasite rate of about
               25 may be reached in 50 days and of up to 500 in 100 days; after
               this the number of mites decreases rapidly.8. The second time an
               individual has scabies he itches at the sites of infection within
               24 hr. His mite population seldom rises to a fraction of the
               height reached in his first infection.9. Reinfection of cured
               cases is much more difficult than infection for the first
               time.10. Sarcoptes causes antibody function in man. This causes a
               partial immunity.11. The mechanism of immunity is due to three
               reactions: (a) scratching by the host which removes the parasites
               mechanically; (b) oedema renders the cuticle unsuitable for
               colonization and causes the mites to vacate their burrows; (c)
               scratching produces sepsis which is fatal to Sarcoptes.12. The
               partial immunity obtained may account for fluctuations in the
               incidence of the disease.",

               high prevalence of scabies in overcrowded settings, particularly
               among children and in tropical regions. We provide an estimate of
               the global burden of scabies using data from the Global Burden of
               Disease (GBD) Study 2015. METHODS: We identified scabies
               epidemiological data sources from an extensive literature search
               and hospital insurance data and analysed data sources with a
               Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2·1, to yield
               prevalence estimates. We combined prevalence estimates with a
               disability weight, measuring disfigurement, itch, and pain caused
               by scabies, to produce years lived with disability (YLDs). With
               an assumed zero mortality from scabies, YLDs were equivalent to
               disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We estimated DALYs for
               195 countries divided into 21 world regions, in both sexes and 20
               age groups, between 1990 and 2015. FINDINGS: Scabies was
               responsible for 0·21\% of DALYs from all conditions studied by
               GBD 2015 worldwide. The world regions of east Asia
               (age-standardised DALYs 136·32), southeast Asia (134·57), Oceania
               (120·34), tropical Latin America (99·94), and south Asia (69·41)
               had the greatest burden of DALYs from scabies. Mean percent
               change of DALY rate from 1990 to 2015 was less than 8\% in all
               world regions, except North America, which had a 23·9\% increase.
               The five individual countries with greatest scabies burden were
               Indonesia (age-standardised DALYs 153·86), China (138·25),
               Timor-Leste (136·67), Vanuatu (131·59), and Fiji (130·91). The
               largest standard deviations of age-standardised DALYs between the
               20 age groups were observed in southeast Asia (60·1), Oceania
               (58·3), and east Asia (56·5), with the greatest DALY burdens in
               children, adolescents, and the elderly. INTERPRETATION: The
               burden of scabies is greater in tropical regions, especially in
               children, adolescents, and elderly people. As a worldwide
               epidemiological assessment, GBD 2015 provides broad and

               effects. These global data might help guide research protocols

               glomerulonephritis (PSGN) in childhood is a risk factor for
               chronic renal disease in later life. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort
               study. SETTING: A remote Aboriginal community in the ``Top End''
               of the Northern Territory that experienced two epidemics of PSGN
               in 1980 and 1987, respectively. PARTICIPANTS: 472 people who were
               aged 2-15 years during either epidemic. They were categorised by
               clinical features recorded during the epidemics as having
               clinically defined PSGN (63), ``abnormal urine'' (haematuria or
               proteinuria; 86) or controls (323). OUTCOME MEASURES: Urinary
               albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR), haematuria (by dipstick
               urinalysis), blood pressure, serum creatinine level, and
               calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during community
               screening in 1992-1998. RESULTS: Overt albuminuria (ACR > 34
               mg/mmol) was present at follow-up in 13\% of the PSGN group, 8\%
               of the abnormal urine group, and 4\% of the control group. The
               odds ratio (OR) for overt albuminuria in those with a history of
               PSGN compared with the control group, adjusted for age and sex,
               was 6.1 (95\% CI, 2.2-16.9). Haematuria (>trace) was present in
               21\% of the PSGN group compared with 7\% of the control group
               (adjusted OR, 3.7; 95\% CI, 1.8-8.0). There were no significant
               differences between the groups in blood pressure, serum
               creatinine level or calculated GFR. CONCLUSION: In this
               population, a history of PSGN in childhood is a risk factor for
               albuminuria and haematuria in later life.",

               communicable disease in Ethiopia, especially among disadvantaged
               and the poor. This current study aims to detect the
               spatiotemporal patterns of scabies in Tigray from 2018 to 2023
               using scabies data aggregated at the zonal level. The study also
               examined the persistent patterns in the spatial variation of
               scabies incidence across the administrative regions during the
               study period. METHOD: We collected scabies data using a weekly
               disease surveillance reporting format of the country from 2018 to
               2023 across all accessible district health facilities in Tigray
               region, Ethiopia. We conducted retrospective analyses using both
               purely spatial and spatiotemporal scan statistic approaches,
               employing a discrete Poisson probability model to identify
               statistically significant clusters of high scabies rates
               throughout the Tigray regional zones in Ethiopia. Our methodology
               involved the use of Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic software
               (SaTScan v10.1.3), R programming software version 4.3.1, and
               ArcGIS Pro for all analyses. RESULTS: A total of 101,116 cases of
               scabies were reported from 2018 to 2023. Our study indicated a
               spatial heterogeneity in the pattern of scabies across Tigray
               region as well as its localization among geographically
               contiguous zones across space, except for the Western zone of
               Tigray where no data was collected. The detected statistically
               significant spatial clusters [Formula: see text] persisted mainly
               in the Central, Eastern and Northwestern zones of Tigray over the
               six years of the study period. The highest relative risk (RR) was
               recorded in year 2021 ([Formula: see text]. The central zone had
               the major clusters of scabies at district level from 2018 to
               2023. The heterogeneous distribution of scabies across Tigray
               could be due to the spatial variations in the determinants of
               scabies (such as socioeconomic status, demographics, and material
               deprivation) across the region. CONCLUSION: An enormous burden of
               scabies was reported over a period of six years. The present
               study found localized clusters of high scabies rates at district
               and zonal levels in Tigray, Ethiopia, possibly due to differences
               in various determinants of scabies such as access to WASH
               services. The findings could help the government and health
               authorities to develop and implement scabies control strategies
               in Tigray, with a focus on high-risk districts and zones to
               ensure optimal resource allocation.",

               databases of LIP clinics for the period 2004-2018. Data were

               Scabies seasonality was evaluated. For children 2). A strong
               seasonality was observed, with a 30\% increase in winter. In
               children <5 years, SSTIs were 4.3 times more frequent in the 3

               population, including all of the Israel Defence Forces personnel.
               METHODS: For the last two decades, the Israel Defence Forces have
               mandated the routine reportage of every case of scabies
               infestation in soldiers to the Epidemiology Department of the
               Army Health Branch. This database was used in the present study
               to analyse the incidence of scabies by season. Scabies was
               defined according to the report by a military physician based on
               the typical clinical presentation, relevant epidemiological data
               and, in most cases, microscopic visualization of the mite.
               RESULTS: The person-time incidence of scabies was higher in
               winter than summer (P < 0.001). The overall risk ratio was 1.31
               (95\% confidence interval 1.28-1.33). Sensitivity analysis
               indicated that no single year was an important source of disease
               heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Scabies in a young adult population
               is more frequent in the cooler months of the year.",

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Scabies is a contagious parasitic disease, a skin
               infestation caused by Scaroptes scabieri, tiny mites that burrow
               under the skin. Outbreaks of scabies can be difficult to control
               and require the implementation of appropriate control programme.
               OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to analyze the
               epidemiology of scabies in north-east Poland, considering
               socio-economic and selected climatic factors. MATERIAL AND
               METHODS: The analysis was based on data reports (n=26,362)
               obtained from the Polish National Health Fund (NFZ) for the
               period 2007-2014. Monthly climate data were collected from the
               Institute of Meteorology and Water Management/National Research
               Institute (IMGW-PIB) in Warsaw, including data on temperature and
               relative humidity. Additionally, the influence of socio-economic
               factors on the prevalence of scabies was analyzed. Data on
               population size, medical staff, and unemployment rate were
               obtained from the Central Statistical Office (GUS) in Warsaw, and
               analyzed using SPSS Statistics 24.0 programme. RESULTS: The age
               group of 10-19 years showed the highest infestation rates.
               Seasonality of scabies was demonstrated. The highest numbers of
               cases were reported during the autumn and winter months. There
               was a significant negative correlation (rho = -0.499; p<0.001)
               between air temperature and the incidence of scabies, and a
               positive correlation (r = 0.532; p<0.001) between relative
               humidity and the number of cases reported. A rise in the
               unemployment rate also caused an increase in the scabies
               incidence rate (r = 0.294; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results
               suggest that an improvement of socio-economic conditions may
               contribute to a reduction in the number of scabies infections.
               The possibility should be considered of monitoring the
               parameters, such as air temperature and humidity, particularly
               when scabies outbreaks occur.",
