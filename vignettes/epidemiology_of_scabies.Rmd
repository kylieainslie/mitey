## Introduction

Scabies is a neglected tropical disease caused by infestation of the
skin with a microscopic mite (Sarcoptes scabiei). Symptoms are
characterized by itchiness and rash at the site of infestation. Scabies
affects around 400 million people per year, and accounts for a large
proportion of skin disease in many low- and middle-income countries
[@who]. A rise in scabies cases has been observed through out Europe in
recent years [@deursen2022; @reichert2021; @redondo-bravo2021;
@lugovic-mihic2020; @amato2019; @dona2023], putting pressure on local
health services. [Elaborate?]

Despite the considerable burden scabies poses annually,
little is known about the disease dynamics of scabies transmission, such
as the incubation time (time from exposure to symptom onset), generation time (time between infection of an index case and a secondary case), serial interval (the time from onset of symptoms in an
index case to the time of symptom onset in a secondary case), growth
rate, and reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases
resulting from one index case). 
A 1944 study by Mellanby [@mellanby1944]
forms much of the basis of our current understanding of scabies
transmission; however, the study was carried out on a small number of
healthy volunteers and may not be representative of the natural
history of scabies in populations in which scabies in widespread. Some important results from Mellanby include... [Add key results from Mellanby 1944: curve of mites over time, time to symptom onset, probability of transmission from secondary objects]

In this work, we aim to estimate epidemiological characteristics of scabies.
It is critical to better understand the underlying disease dynamics of
scabies to 1) assess current spread and 2) inform infection control
policy. Some modelling work has been performed to study the potential
impacts of intervention strategies, such as mass drug administration, on
scabies transmission [@kinyanjui2018; @lydeamore2019; @tellioglu2023];
however, the values used to parameterise these models are based largely
on Mellanby's 1944 study and use information about the mite life-cycle
to approximate quantities such as latent period and infectious period.
However, this information doesn't necessarily provide good estimates for
transmission potential in humans. For example, Kinyanjui et al.
[@kinyanjui2018] assume a latent period of 7-14 days to allow for the
time for the time it takes for a fertilised female mite to reproduce and
incorporate it into a susceptible-exposed-infectious model of scabies
transmission. However, this assumes an equal chance of infectiousness
despite the number of mites inhabiting an infested indivual. Mellanby
[@mellanby1944] shows that the probability of onward transmission of
scabies is rare when the number of mites on an individual is low and
increases as the mite population grows. A better approximation of the
disease process can be obtained using the generation time or serial
interval; however, no such estimates exist for scabies.

Additionally, the growth rate and reproduction number are quantities
that describe how fast an infectious disease spreads. They are also used
to determine appropriate control measures to reduce the number of
secondary infections so that an epidemic dies out. However,
in the case of scabies, the basic reproduction number, the average number of secondary infections resulting from one index case in a completely susceptible population, has never been
described. This makes it immensely difficult to determine what level of
control measures are needed to contain disease spread. As evidence
continues to suggest that scabies is a growing problem in European countries and remains a large problem elsewhere, it is important to describe the epidemiological characteristics of scabies so that the required control efforts to curb scabies epidemics can be determined.

In this study, we use epidemic curves of scabies outbreaks from the
literature to estimate the serial interval. We use data on weekly
scabies cases in the Netherlands to estimate time-varying reproduction
number and annual growth rate. [not sure this should be in the intro]

## Methods

### Data Sources

We used reported symptom onset dates of cases from previously published studies of scabies
outbreaks (Table \@ref(tab:data_sources_table)) to estimate the serial
interval of scabies. When the original study data was not provided, we
reconstructed the data from the published epidemic curves. 

### Serial Interval

Using the dates of symptom onset for scabies cases from six different studies of scabies
outbreaks (Table \@ref(tab:si_results_tab)), we estimated the mean
and standard deviation of the serial interval distribution using the
method proposed by Vink et al. [@vink2014]. The method involves
calculating the index case-to-case (ICC) interval for each person, where
the person with the greatest value for number of days since symptom
onset will be considered the index case. The rest of the individuals
will have an ICC interval calculated as the number of days between their
symptom onset and the index case. We assumed a Normal serial interval
distribution. We performed a sensitivity analysis in which a Gamma
distribution was assumed as the serial interval distribution [TODO!].

We also performed a Bayesian meta-analysis using the `brms` package in R
[@burkner2017] to estimate the pooled mean serial interval. We used a
Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model. We chose to use a random
effects model because we assume that each study has its own “true”
serial interval, which has been sampled from an overarching distribution of
true serial intervals [@harrer]. We specified a prior distribution N(100,
50) for the true pooled mean and Cauchy(0,1) for the
between-study heterogeneity. We performed sensitivity analyses on our
choices of prior distributions [TODO!].

### Growth rate

We estimated the annual growth rate of scabies cases by fitting an
exponential growth model to annual incidence of scabies per 1000 people
from 2011 to 2023 in the Netherlands [@nivel]. Using the fitted
exponential growth model and the estimated growth rate, we then
determined the projected incidence of scabies per 1000 people until 2033
if no interventions are implemented. We used bootstrapping with 1000
samples to obtain 95% confidence bounds for the projected incidence of
scabies per 1000 people.

### Reproduction Number

We obtained weekly reported cases of scabies from 2011 to 2023 in the
Netherlands [@nivel; @deursen2022]. We performed spectral analysis on
the time series of weekly scabies cases using a modified Daniell kernel
(m = 2) for smoothing to identify typical frequencies within the time
series. To estimate time-varying reproduction number, we first randomly
assigned each reported case a date of symptom onset in the week in which
the case was reported. Using the daily time series, we applied the
method proposed by Wallinga and Teunis [@wallinga_teunis2004] to
estimate the time-varying reproduction number by determining the
likelihood of an event occurring for every pair of time points
[@wallinga2007]. The method requires the specification of the serial
interval distribution. We assumed a Normal serial interval distribution
with mean 91.2 and standard deviation 22.79, as estimated previously. To
obtain confidence intervals on the daily reproduction number, we used 
bootstrapping.

All analyses were performed in R 4.4.0 [@R-base].

## Results

### Serial Interval

We estimated the mean and standard deviation of the serial interval
using the epidemic curves from each study (Table \@ref(si_results_tab)). 

[Figure of epidemic curves!]

There was considerable variation between
studies with the largest estimated mean serial interval of 167.34 (SD =
9.72) from data from Kaburi et al. [@kaburi2019] which describes an
outbreak in a preschool in Ghana. The smallest estimated mean serial
interval was 16.11 (SD = 2.42), and was estimated from data from Larrosa
et al. [@larrosa2003] which describes an outbreak in a hospital in
Spain.

To obtain a pooled estimate of mean serial interval, we performed a
Bayesian meta-analysis with random intercepts for each study. We
estimated a pooled mean serial interval of 91.20 (95% CI: 45.84, 138.04)
(Figure \@ref(fsi_multi-plot)B). As we saw with the individual study
estimates (Table \@ref(si_results_tab)), the meta-analysis provided
further evidence of substantial heterogeneity among studies due to a
large value of the standard deviation of the random intercepts (60.7).
The large variation in the mean serial interval estimates can be
visualised by plotting the estimated distributions of each study's
serial interval shown in Figure \@ref(si_multi-plot)A. A normal
distribution is assumed, and is parameterized by the estimated mean and
standard deviation of serial interval for each study.

### Growth Rate and Basic Reproduction Number

We estimated the annual growth rate of scabies cases by fitting an
exponential growth model to annual incidence of scabies per 1000 people
from 2011 to 2023 in the Netherlands [@nivel]. We estimated an annual
growth rate of 0.353 (95% CI: 0.152, 0.452). Using the fitted
exponential growth model and the estimated growth rate, we then
determined the projected incidence of scabies per 1000 people until 2033
if no interventions are implemented. We found that there could be a
substantial increase in scabies incidence in the next 10 years in the
Netherlands if no measures are taken to mitigate scabies spread (Figure
\@ref(fig:growth_rate_fig)).

[TODO] Add estimate of basic reproduction number based on growth rate and generation time (use mean serial interval). R0 = 1 + (0.353 * 1/b), where b is the generation time in days.

### Reproduction Number

We first performed a spectral analysis on the time series of weekly
scabies cases in Netherlands from 2011 to 2023 using a modified Daniell
kernel (m = 2) for smoothing. We found typical frequencies at 1/51.4
weeks and at 1/26.67 weeks (where 26.67 weeks is \~187 days). This
suggests that there is a generation interval at 187 days and strong
annual periodicity. We also estimated time-varying reproduction number
and plotted it against season. It appears that peak transmissibility
occurs in the autumn and in some years extend into winter (Figure
\\\@ref(rt_plot)).

```{r rt_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Time-varying reproduction number of scabies transmission. Colored bands denote season. Winter = December 1 – February 28 (or 29 on leap year); Spring = March 1 – May 31; Summer = June 1 – August. 31; Autumn = September 1 – November 31.", out.width="100%"}

```
Note: This is a place-holder figure.

# Discussion

Still need to flush this out.

Discuss time-series trends and population that it typically occurs in in
NL (young adults/college students)

Discuss why estimates of mean serial interval across studies are so
different (different populations and identification of symptom onset may
be delayed).

Discuss limitations of the approach and caveats for interpretation.

## Sensitivity Analyses

TODO:

 - add gamma distribution to Vink et al. method and re-run estimation

 - re-run meta-analysis assuming gamma distribution

 - potentially remove Uganda estimate from meta-analysis because it's
community transmission and not a confined setting (e.g., school,
hospital, care home)

 - check prior assumptions for meta-analysis
 
 - more in-depth analysis of Rt
