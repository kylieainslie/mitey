\title{Generate Synthetic Epidemic Data Using the Renewal Equation}
\usage{
generate_synthetic_epidemic(
  true_r,
  si_mean,
  si_sd,
  si_dist = "gamma",
  initial_cases = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{true_r}{numeric vector; the true time-varying reproduction numbers. The length
of this vector determines the number of days in the simulated epidemic}

\item{si_mean}{numeric; the mean of the serial interval distribution in days}

\item{si_sd}{numeric; the standard deviation of the serial interval distribution in days}

\item{si_dist}{character; the distribution family for the serial interval. Must be
either "gamma" (default) or "normal". Gamma is recommended as it
naturally restricts to positive values}

\item{initial_cases}{integer; the number of cases on the first day of the epidemic.
Defaults to 10}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{date}: Date sequence starting from "2023-01-01"
\item \code{true_r}: The input reproduction number values
\item \code{incidence}: Simulated daily case counts
}
}
\description{
Simulates epidemic incidence data with known reproduction numbers using the renewal
equation framework. This function is useful for testing and validating reproduction
number estimation methods, as it generates synthetic outbreaks with ground truth
R values that can be compared against estimated values.
}
\details{
The function implements the discrete renewal equation:
\deqn{\lambda_t = \sum_{s=1}^{t-1} I_s \cdot R_s \cdot w(t-s)}

where \eqn{\lambda_t} is the expected number of new infections at time \eqn{t},
\eqn{I_s} is the incidence at time \eqn{s}, \eqn{R_s} is the reproduction number
at time \eqn{s}, and \eqn{w(t-s)} is the probability mass function of the serial
interval distribution for interval \eqn{t-s}.

New cases at each time point are drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean
\eqn{\lambda_t}, introducing realistic stochastic variation while maintaining
the specified reproduction number trajectory.

The serial interval distribution is truncated at the 99th percentile to avoid
computationally expensive calculations for very long tails. For the normal
distribution, the probability mass function is normalized to ensure proper
probability weights.

This function is particularly useful for:
\itemize{
\item Validating reproduction number estimation methods
\item Testing the performance of epidemiological models
\item Generating realistic epidemic scenarios for research
\item Creating training data for machine learning approaches
}

# Simple epidemic with constant R = 1.5

# Epidemic with declining R (e.g., intervention effect)

epidemic2 <- generate_synthetic_epidemic(
  true_r = declining_r,
  si_mean = 5,
  si_sd = 2,
  si_dist = "gamma",
  initial_cases = 5

# Epidemic with seasonal pattern
days <- 100
seasonal_r <- 1.2 + 0.5 * sin(2 * pi * (1:days) / 365 * 7) # Weekly seasonality
epidemic3 <- generate_synthetic_epidemic(
  true_r = seasonal_r,
  si_mean = 6,
  si_sd = 2.5,
  si_dist = "normal"
