\title{Calculate serial interval mixture density assuming underlying normal distribution}
\usage{
f_norm(x, w1, w2, w3, mu, sigma)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{quantile or vector of quantiles (time in days since index case symptom onset)}

\item{w1}{probability weight of being a co-primary case}

\item{w2}{probability weight of being a primary-secondary case}

\item{w3}{probability weight of being a primary-tertiary case}

\item{mu}{mean serial interval in days (can be any real number)}

\item{sigma}{standard deviation of serial interval in days (must be positive)}
}
\value{
Vector of weighted density values corresponding to input quantiles x.
Returns the sum of densities from all four transmission routes.
}
\description{
This function computes the weighted mixture density for serial intervals based on
different transmission routes in an outbreak. It implements part of the Vink et al.
(2014) method for serial interval estimation, assuming an underlying normal
distribution for the serial interval.
}
\details{
The function models four distinct transmission routes:
\itemize{
\item Co-primary (CP): Cases infected simultaneously from the same source
\item Primary-secondary (PS): Direct transmission from index case
\item Primary-tertiary (PT): Transmission through one intermediate case
\item Primary-quaternary (PQ): Transmission through two intermediate cases
}

Each route contributes to the overall serial interval distribution with different
means and variances. The co-primary component uses a half-normal distribution
to model simultaneous infections (preventing negative serial intervals), while
subsequent generations follow normal distributions with means that are multiples
of the base serial interval.

This function is primarily used internally by \code{\link{si_estim}} when
\code{dist = "normal"} is specified (the default), and by \code{\link{plot_si_fit}}
for visualizing fitted distributions. The normal distribution assumption allows
for negative serial intervals, which may be more realistic for some pathogens.

The weights w1, w2, and w3 must sum to <= 1, with the remaining probability
(1 - w1 - w2 - w3) assigned to primary-quaternary cases. The transmission
route distributions are parameterized as:
Co-primary: Half-normal with scale parameter derived from sigma
Primary-secondary: Normal(mu, sigma)
Primary-tertiary: Normal(2*mu, sqrt(2)\emph{sigma)
Primary-quaternary: Normal(3}mu, sqrt(3)*sigma)
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
x <- seq(0, 400, by = 1)
density_values <- f_norm(x, w1 = 0.15, w2 = 0.50, w3 = 0.25, mu = 123, sigma = 32)
plot(x, density_values, type = "l")
}
