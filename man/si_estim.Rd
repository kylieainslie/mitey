\title{Estimate Serial Interval Distribution Using the Vink Method}
\usage{
si_estim(dat, n = 50, dist = "normal", init = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{numeric vector; index case-to-case (ICC) intervals in days. These are
calculated as the time difference between symptom onset in each case and
symptom onset in the index case (case with earliest onset). Must contain
at least 2 values. Values should be non-negative in most epidemiological
contexts, though negative values are allowed for normal distribution}

\item{n}{integer; number of EM algorithm iterations to perform. More iterations
generally improve convergence but increase computation time. Defaults to 50,
which is typically sufficient for convergence}

\item{dist}{character; the assumed parametric family for the serial interval distribution. Must be either:
\itemize{
\item \code{"normal"} (default): Allows negative serial intervals, uses 7 mixture components
\item \code{"gamma"}: Restricts to positive serial intervals, uses 4 mixture components
}}

\item{init}{numeric vector of length 2; initial values for the mean and standard
deviation to start the EM algorithm. If \code{NULL} (default), uses the
sample mean and sample standard deviation of the input data. Providing
good initial values can improve convergence, especially for challenging datasets}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: Estimated mean of the serial interval distribution (days)
\item \code{sd}: Estimated standard deviation of the serial interval distribution (days)
\item \code{wts}: Numeric vector of estimated component weights representing the
probability that cases belong to each transmission route. Length depends
on distribution choice (7 for normal, 4 for gamma)
}
}
\description{
Estimates the mean and standard deviation of the serial interval distribution from
outbreak data using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm developed by Vink
et al. (2014). The serial interval is defined as the time between symptom onset
in a primary case and symptom onset in a secondary case infected by that primary case.
}
\details{
The Vink method addresses the challenge that individual transmission pairs are
typically unknown in outbreak investigations. Instead, it uses index case-to-case
(ICC) intervals - the time differences between the case with earliest symptom onset
(index case) and all other cases - to infer the underlying serial interval
distribution through a mixture modeling approach.

\strong{Methodological Approach:}

The method models ICC intervals as arising from a mixture of four transmission routes:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Co-Primary (CP)}: Cases infected simultaneously from the same source
\item \strong{Primary-Secondary (PS)}: Direct transmission from index case
\item \strong{Primary-Tertiary (PT)}: Second-generation transmission
\item \strong{Primary-Quaternary (PQ)}: Third-generation transmission
}

The EM algorithm iteratively:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{E-step}: Calculates the probability that each ICC interval belongs
to each transmission route component
\item \strong{M-step}: Updates the serial interval parameters (mean, standard deviation)
and component weights based on these probabilities
}

\strong{Distribution Choice:}

\itemize{
\item \strong{Normal distribution}: Allows negative serial intervals (useful for
modeling co-primary infections) and uses 7 components (positive and negative
pairs for PS, PT, PQ routes plus CP)
\item \strong{Gamma distribution}: Restricts to positive values only, uses 4 components
(CP, PS, PT, PQ without negative pairs). Recommended when negative serial
intervals are epidemiologically implausible
}

\strong{Key Assumptions:}

\itemize{
\item The case with earliest symptom onset is the index case
\item Transmission occurs through at most 4 generations
\item Serial intervals follow the specified parametric distribution
\item Cases represent a single, homogeneously-mixing outbreak
}

\strong{Input Data Preparation:}

To prepare ICC intervals from outbreak data:
\enumerate{
\item Identify the case with the earliest symptom onset date (index case)
\item Calculate the time difference (in days) between each case's onset
date and the index case onset date
\item The resulting values are the ICC intervals for input to this function
}

\strong{Convergence and Diagnostics:}

The EM algorithm typically converges within 20-50 iterations. Users should:
\itemize{
\item Examine the fitted distribution using \code{\link{plot_si_fit}}
\item Consider alternative distribution choices if fit is poor
\item Try different initial values if results seem unreasonable
\item Ensure adequate sample size (generally >20 cases recommended)

\examples{
# Example 1: Basic usage with simulated data
# Simulate ICC intervals from a mixed outbreak
set.seed(123)
simulated_icc <- c(
  rep(1, 38),   # Short intervals (co-primary cases)
  rep(2, 39),   #
  rep(3, 30),   # Medium intervals (primary-secondary)
  rep(4, 17),   #
  rep(5, 7)     # Longer intervals (higher generation)
)

# Estimate serial interval parameters
result <- si_estim(simulated_icc, dist = "normal")


# Example 2: Using gamma distribution
result_gamma <- si_estim(simulated_icc, dist = "gamma")
