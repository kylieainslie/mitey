\title{Compute Serial Interval Component Integrals for All Transmission Routes}
\usage{
integrate_components_wrapper(d, mu, sigma, dist = "normal")
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{numeric; the index case-to-case (ICC) interval in days. Represents the
time difference between the symptom onset of the index case (latest case)
and the current case being evaluated. Must be non-negative}

\item{mu}{numeric; the mean of the serial interval distribution in days. Must be
positive for meaningful epidemiological interpretation}

\item{sigma}{numeric; the standard deviation of the serial interval distribution
in days. Must be positive}

\item{dist}{character; the assumed underlying distribution family for the serial
interval. Must be either "normal" or "gamma". Defaults to "normal".
Gamma distribution is often preferred for serial intervals as it
naturally restricts to positive values}
}
\value{
numeric vector; integrated likelihood values for each relevant transmission
route component. The length depends on the distribution:
\itemize{
\item Normal distribution: 7 values (components 1-7)
\item Gamma distribution: 4 values (components 1, 2, 4, 6)
}
}
\description{
This wrapper function efficiently computes the likelihood contributions for all
relevant transmission route components for a given index case-to-case (ICC) interval.
It is a key component of the Vink method's Expectation-Maximization algorithm for
estimating serial interval parameters from outbreak data.
}
\details{
The function handles different integration scenarios based on the distribution type
and ICC interval value:
\itemize{
\item For \strong{normal distribution}: Uses all 7 components representing the full
mixture of transmission routes (co-primary, primary-secondary with positive
and negative components, primary-tertiary, and primary-quaternary routes)
\item For \strong{gamma distribution}: Uses components 1, 2, 4, and 6 only, as
the gamma distribution naturally handles only positive serial intervals,
eliminating the need for negative component pairs
\item For \strong{ICC interval = 0}: Uses upper integration (\code{lower = FALSE})
representing the special case of simultaneous symptom onset
\item For \strong{ICC interval > 0}: Uses lower integration (\code{lower = TRUE})
representing the standard transmission likelihood calculation
}

This function is primarily used internally by \code{si_estim()} as part of the
E-step in the EM algorithm. Each component represents a different hypothesis
about the transmission route:
\itemize{
\item Component 1: Co-primary transmission (simultaneous exposure)
\item Components 2-3: Primary-secondary transmission (direct transmission)
\item Components 4-5: Primary-tertiary transmission (second generation)
\item Components 6-7: Primary-quaternary transmission (third generation)
}

For gamma distributions, components 3, 5, and 7 are omitted because the gamma
distribution naturally handles the asymmetry that these components would otherwise
model in the normal distribution case.
