\title{Estimate Time-Varying Case Reproduction Number Using Wallinga-Lipsitch Method}
\usage{
wallinga_lipsitch(
  incidence,
  dates,
  si_mean,
  si_sd,
  si_dist = "gamma",
  smoothing = 0,
  bootstrap = FALSE,
  n_bootstrap = 1000,
  conf_level = 0.95,
  shift = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{numeric vector; daily case counts. Must be non-negative integers
or counts. Length must match \code{dates}}

\item{dates}{vector; dates corresponding to each incidence count. Must be the same
length as \code{incidence}. Can be Date objects or anything coercible
to dates}

\item{si_mean}{numeric; mean of the serial interval distribution in days. Must be
positive. Typically estimated from contact tracing data or literature}

\item{si_sd}{numeric; standard deviation of the serial interval distribution in days.
Must be positive}

\item{si_dist}{character; distribution family for the serial interval. Options:
\itemize{
\item \code{"gamma"} (default): Recommended for most applications as it naturally
restricts to positive values
\item \code{"normal"}: Allows negative serial intervals, useful when co-primary
infections are suspected
}}

\item{smoothing}{integer; window size for temporal smoothing of R estimates. Use 0
for no smoothing (default), or positive integers for moving average
smoothing over the specified number of days}

\item{bootstrap}{logical; whether to calculate bootstrap confidence intervals.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Setting to \code{TRUE} increases
computation time but provides uncertainty quantification}

\item{n_bootstrap}{integer; number of bootstrap samples when \code{bootstrap = TRUE}.
More samples provide more stable intervals but increase computation
time. Defaults to 1000}

\item{conf_level}{numeric; confidence level for bootstrap intervals, between 0 and 1.
Defaults to 0.95 (95\% confidence intervals)}

\item{shift}{logical; whether to shift R estimates forward by one mean serial interval.
When \code{TRUE}, adds a \code{shifted_date} column for comparison with
instantaneous reproduction number estimates. Defaults to \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{date}: Original input dates
\item \code{incidence}: Original input case counts
\item \code{R}: Estimated case reproduction number
\item \code{R_corrected}: Case reproduction number with right-truncation correction
\item \code{R_lower, R_upper}: Bootstrap confidence intervals for R (if \code{bootstrap = TRUE})
\item \code{R_corrected_lower, R_corrected_upper}: Bootstrap confidence intervals for
R_corrected (if \code{bootstrap = TRUE})
\item \code{shifted_date}: Dates shifted forward by mean serial interval (if \code{shift = TRUE})
}
}
\description{
Estimates the time-varying case reproduction number (R_c) from daily incidence data
using the method developed by Wallinga and Lipsitch (2007). The case reproduction
number represents the average number of secondary infections generated by cases
with symptom onset at time t, making it useful for retrospective outbreak analysis.
}
\details{
The method calculates the relative likelihood that each earlier case infected each
later case based on their time differences and the serial interval distribution, then
aggregates these likelihoods to estimate reproduction numbers. The approach makes
minimal assumptions beyond specifying the serial interval distribution.

Key features:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Pairwise likelihood approach}: Considers all epidemiologically plausible transmission pairs (earlier to later cases)
\item \strong{Right-truncation correction}: Adjusts for unobserved future cases (see \code{\link{calculate_truncation_correction}})
\item \strong{Bootstrap confidence intervals}: Quantifies estimation uncertainty
\item \strong{Temporal shifting}: Optional alignment with instantaneous R estimates
\item \strong{Flexible smoothing}: User-controlled temporal smoothing of estimates
}

The Wallinga-Lipsitch method estimates the case reproduction number by:
\enumerate{
\item Computing transmission likelihoods from each earlier case to each later case based on the serial interval distribution
\item Normalizing these likelihoods so they sum to 1 for each potential infectee
\item Aggregating normalized likelihoods to estimate expected secondary cases per primary case
\item Applying corrections for right-truncation bias
}

\strong{Right-truncation correction} accounts for secondary cases that may occur
after the observation period ends (see \code{\link{calculate_truncation_correction}}). This correction is particularly important for recent cases in the time series.

\strong{Bootstrap confidence intervals} are calculated by resampling individual
cases with replacement, providing non-parametric uncertainty estimates that
account for both Poisson sampling variation and method uncertainty.
}
\note{
The case reproduction number differs from the instantaneous reproduction
number in timing: R_c reflects the reproductive potential of cases by their
symptom onset date, while instantaneous R reflects transmission potential
at the time of infection. Use \code{shift = TRUE} for comparisons with
instantaneous R estimates.
