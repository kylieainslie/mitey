\title{Generate Bootstrap Sample of Case Incidence}
\usage{
generate_case_bootstrap(incidence)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{numeric vector; daily case counts (non-negative integers)}
}
\value{
numeric vector; bootstrapped daily incidence of the same length as input.
Total number of cases remains the same but their temporal distribution varies
}
\description{
Creates a bootstrap sample by resampling individual cases with replacement,
then reconstructing daily incidence counts. This maintains the temporal
distribution while introducing sampling variation for uncertainty estimation.
}
\examples{
# This function is used internally for bootstrap confidence intervals
# For bootstrap reproduction number estimates, see ?wallinga_lipsitch

\dontrun{
# Example usage through main interface:
dates <- seq(as.Date("2023-01-01"), by = "day", length.out = 10)
incidence <- c(1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 15, 10, 6, 3, 1)

# Get bootstrap confidence intervals
results <- wallinga_lipsitch(
  incidence = incidence,
  dates = dates,
  si_mean = 7,
  si_sd = 3,
  si_dist = "gamma",
  bootstrap = TRUE,
  n_bootstrap = 100
)

# The bootstrap sampling happens automatically inside wallinga_lipsitch()
head(results)
}
