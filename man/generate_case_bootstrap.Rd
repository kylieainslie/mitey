\title{Generate Bootstrap Sample of Case Incidence}
\usage{
generate_case_bootstrap(incidence)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{numeric vector; daily case counts (non-negative integers)}
}
\value{
numeric vector; bootstrapped daily incidence of the same length as input.
Total number of cases remains the same but their temporal distribution varies
}
\description{
Creates a bootstrap sample by resampling individual cases with replacement,
then reconstructing daily incidence counts. This maintains the temporal
distribution while introducing sampling variation for uncertainty estimation.
