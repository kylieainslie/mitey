# What even is scabies?

## *Sarcoptes scabiei*
::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
  - Scabies is a disease caused by infestation of the skin with a microscopic mite.
  - Symptoms are characterized by itchiness and rash at the site of infestation.

# Do people still get scabies?

## Scabies Worldwide
- Scabies affects around 400 million people per year.
- Accounts for a large proportion of skin disease in many low- and middle-income countries

## Scabies in Europe (then)
- Scabies infections were a common affliction in Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s 
  - Highest incidence seen in 1918 and 1945.

## Scabies in Europe (now)
- A rise in scabies cases has been observed through out Europe in recent years.

## Ok, so what's the big deal?
- Not going to die
- blah blah blah

# What can we do about it?

## What we know
- Surprisingly little.
- A series of studies in the 1940s form much of the basis of our current understanding of scabies transmission. 

## What we know
- the incubation period, or time to symptom onset, 
  - is 4-6 weeks for first infections and 
  - 24 hours for subsequent infections; 
- the number of parasites on a person's body peaks at around 100 days
- the probability of transmission via a secondary object (e.g., bed sheets) is low
    - i.e., most transmissions occurs from person-to-person contact. 

## What we don't know
- Little is known about the disease dynamics of scabies transmission, such as 
  - *generation time:* time between infection of an index case and a secondary case), 
  - *serial interval:* the time from onset of symptoms in an index case to the time of symptom onset in a secondary case
  - *growth rate*
  - *reproduction number:* the average number of secondary cases resulting from one index case.

## The point of all this
We aim to estimate key epidemiological characteristics of scabies
  - serial interval
  - growth rate
  - reproduction number

# Let's dive in!

## Serial Interval
Using the dates of symptom onset for scabies cases from four different
studies [@ariza2013; @kaburi2019; @tjon-kon-fat2021; @akunzirwe2023] of scabies outbreaks, we
estimated the mean and standard deviation of the serial interval
distribution using the method proposed by Vink et al. [@vink2014].

[epidemic curves from 4 studies here]

## Serial Interval
The method involves calculating the index case-to-case (ICC) interval for
each person, where the person with the greatest value for number of days since symptom onset will be considered the index case. The rest of the individuals will have an ICC interval calculated as the number of days between their symptom onset and the index case. We assumed that serial interval distributions for scabies can be approximated by a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

## Serial Interval
[Include table of results and epidemic curve with fitted distribution]

## Serial Interval
- To obtain a pooled estimate of mean serial interval, we performed a
Bayesian meta-analysis with random intercepts for each study. 
- We estimated a pooled mean serial interval of 123.24 days (95% credible
interval: 91.44, 153.41 days)

[Meta-analysis figure]

## Growth Rate
- We estimated the annual growth rate of scabies cases by fitting a generalized linear model (GLM) with a quasipoisson link to the annual number of scabies diagnoses per 1000 people from 2011 to 2023 in the Netherlands.

- We estimated an annual growth rate of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.2, 0.3)

[growth rate figure]

## Basic Reproduction Number $R_0$
- We can relate the growth rate to the basic reproduction number as
$R_0 = \exp(r*T – (1/2) r^2 s^2)$, 
where $r$ is the annual growth rate, $T$ is the mean generation time (in years), and $s^2$ is the variance of the generation time distribution.

- This gives us an $R_0 = 1.09 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.11)$

## Time-varying Reproduction Number $R_t$

## Time-varying Reproduction Number $R_t$

[Rt plot here]

# Now what?

## Policy Implications
 - We estimated that $R_0=1.09$
 - Therefore, minimal control measures could be employed to decrease the reproduction number below one, such as 
    - educating the age groups (adolescents and young adults) in which scabies are most prevalent about the causes and symptoms of scabies infections, 
    - requiring a scabies check for university students prior to the school year, or 
    - informing GPs about the higher risk of scabies in certain groups to more quickly diagnose patients with symptoms consistent with a scabies infestation.
