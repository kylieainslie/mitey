# What even is scabies?

## *Sarcoptes scabiei*

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Scabies is a disease caused by infestation of the skin with a microscopic mite.
-   Symptoms are characterized by itchiness and rash at the site of infestation.

# Do people still get scabies?

## Scabies Worldwide

-   Scabies affects around 400 million people per year.
-   Accounts for a large proportion of skin disease in many low- and middle-income countries

## Scabies in Europe (then)

-   Scabies infections were a common affliction in Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s
    -   Highest incidence seen in 1918 and 1945.

## Ok, so what's the big deal?

-   The global disease burden of scabies is low compared to other infectious diseases

-   Disease severity is also low - you're not going to die

-   BUT

-   Secondary infections can lead to severe outcomes

-   No simple diagnostic test for scabies

    -   diagnoses rely on clinical assessment (more GP visits)

-   scabies can have economic implications for both the patients and the healthcare system

# What can we do about it?

## What we know

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Surprisingly little.
-   A series of studies in the 1940s form much of the basis of our current understanding of scabies transmission.

## What we know
-   the probability of transmission via a secondary object (e.g., bed sheets) is low
    -   i.e., most transmissions occurs from person-to-person contact.

## What we don't know

-   Little is known about the disease dynamics of scabies transmission, such as
    -   *generation time:* time between infection of an index case and a secondary case),
    -   *serial interval:* the time from onset of symptoms in an index case to the time of symptom onset in a secondary case
    -   *growth rate*
    -   *reproduction number:* the average number of secondary cases resulting from one index case.

## The point of all this

We aim to estimate key epidemiological characteristics of scabies - serial interval - growth rate - reproduction number

# Let's dive in!

## Serial Interval

- We used data on date of symptom onset for scabies cases from four different outbreaks 
- **Aim:** Estimated the mean and standard deviation of the serial interval distribution

\[epidemic curves from 4 studies here\]

## Serial Interval

- First, we calculate the index case-to-case (ICC) interval for each person,
  - **index case:** the person with the greatest value for number of days since symptom onset. 
  - **"secondary" cases:** have an ICC interval calculated as the number of days between their symptom onset day and the index case. 
  
*Assumption:* Serial interval distributions for scabies can be approximated by a Normal distribution.

\[include graphic of ICC interval\]

## Serial Interval

## Serial Interval
::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   We performed a Bayesian meta-analysis with random intercepts.
-   We estimated a pooled mean serial interval of 123.24 days (95% credible interval: 91.44, 153.41 days)

## Growth Rate
::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
- We estimated the annual growth rate of scabies cases
  - Fit GLM to the annual number of scabies diagnoses per 1000 people.
- **Estimated an annual growth rate:** 0.25 (95% CI: 0.2, 0.3)

![](growth_rate_plot.png)

:::::

## Basic Reproduction Number $R_0$

-   We can relate the growth rate to the basic reproduction number as 
$$R_0 = \exp(r*T – (1/2) r^2 s^2)$$ 
    - $r$ is the annual growth rate, 
    - $T$ is the mean generation time (in years), and 
    - $s^2$ is the variance of the generation time distribution.

-   This gives us an $R_0 = 1.09$ $(95\% CI: 1.07, 1.11)$

## Time-varying Reproduction Number $R_t$

![Incidence of scabies infections per 1000 people in the Netherlands by date of diagnosis.](nivel_epidemic_curve.png){.absolute .r-stretch} 

## Time-varying Reproduction Number $R_t$

![](rt_plot.png){.absolute height="90%"}

# Now what?

## Policy Implications

-   We estimated that $R_0=1.09$
-   Therefore, minimal control measures could be employed to decrease the reproduction number below one, such as
    -   educating the age groups (adolescents and young adults) in which scabies are most prevalent about the causes and symptoms of scabies infections,
    -   requiring a scabies check for university students prior to the school year, or
    -   informing GPs about the higher risk of scabies in certain groups to more quickly diagnose patients with symptoms consistent with a scabies infestation.

## This is only the beginning

- The estimated epidemiological quantities can be used to parameterise mathematical models of scabies spread 
- There is still a lot that we don't know
  - Future work should focus on obtaining more precise estimates of the underlying quantities that govern scabies spread.
